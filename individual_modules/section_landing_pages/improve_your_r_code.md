By the end of this course, you will:

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable R code by following the tidyverse style guide.
- Use benchmarking tools like `microbenchmark` to assess code performance.
- Optimise code execution using techniques such as vectorisation and parallel processing.
- Make use of packages such as `data.table`, `parallel`, `parallelly`, and `Rcpp` to write faster R programs.
- Understand and apply reproducible and stylistic practices using tools like `styler`.
