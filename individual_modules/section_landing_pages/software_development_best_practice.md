# Software Development Best Practice

## Overview 

The course is designed to be interactive, though all related resources are available on the following pages.

This course comprises two two-hour sessions. The course is designed to be interactive and so will be delivered within a seminar style with live demonstrations and activities. We have allowed plenty of time for discussion and questions throughout - please simply shout out any questions/comments you have or raise your physical/virtual hand.
