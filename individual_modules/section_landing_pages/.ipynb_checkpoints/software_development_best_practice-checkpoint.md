# Software Development Best Practice

## Overview 

This course comprises two two-hour sessions. The course is designed to be interactive and so will be delivered within a seminar style with live demonstrations and activities. We have allowed plenty of time for discussion and questions throughout - please simply shout out any questions/comments you have or raise your physical/virtual hand. We will also have a short comfort break approximately three quarters of the way through the session. We will also share the slides and there is a list of resources on the website for this course.

## Course Objectives 
- On completion of this course, we will:
    - have a high-level understanding of software development for research.
    - be able to collaborate on code effectively.
    - be able to improve the reproducibility of our research by understanding how to make our code useful to others.
    - have the necessary foundations for intermediate level courses that will delve deeper into software development topics.

## Pre-requisite Knowledge

There is no pre-requisite knowledge and the workshop is designed to be appropriate for anyone interested in software development.
