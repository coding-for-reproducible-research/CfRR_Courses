# Introduction to GPUs

## Overview 
Welcome to the Introduction to GPU Programming course! This course has been designed to give you a practical foundation in GPU computing for scientific and technical applications. You will learn the essential concepts of GPU architectures, explore how to run code on modern accelerators, and develop hands-on skills in managing environments, running jobs on HPC systems, and optimising performance. The focus will be on applying these skills through guided exercises and projects in numerical modelling and simulation.

## Course Objectives
- Understand the fundamental principles of GPU architectures and parallel programming models.  
- Configure and manage software environments for GPU computing using **Spack**.  
- Submit and manage GPU-enabled jobs on HPC systems with **Slurm**.  
- Diagnose performance bottlenecks using profiling tools, and apply strategies for performance optimisation.  
- Implement GPU-accelerated numerical models, such as a **temperature diffusion solver**.  
- Apply knowledge to a capstone project, extending **Conwayâ€™s Game of Life** to explore GPU performance, scalability, and custom extensions.
  
## Pre-requisite Knowledge

## Resources 

The job submission scripts specifically configured for use on the University of Exeter ISCA HPC system are available [here](../intro_to_GPUs/zip_files/exeter_isca_slurm_submission_scripts.zip).  

General-purpose job submission scripts, which can serve as a starting point for use on other HPC systems (with minor modifications required for this course), are available [here](../intro_to_GPUs/zip_files/slurm_submission_scripts.zip).  

The Python scripts used in this course can be downloaded [here](../intro_to_GPUs/zip_files/scripts.zip).  

All supplementary files required for the course are available [here](../intro_to_GPUs/zip_files/files.zip).
