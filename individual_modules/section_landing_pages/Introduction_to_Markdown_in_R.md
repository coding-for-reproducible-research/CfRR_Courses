# Introduction to Markdown in R 

## Course description 

Reproducibility is a core feature of successful research software development and data science projects. Fully reproducable workflows can be created by integrating data with code and outputs using a special type of text language called "Markdown". This course will introduce you to the Markdown langauge and conceptualise the benefits towards ensuring reproducibility in coding-based research activities. You will also gain hands-on experience of creating reproducible Markdown documents using R: a popular coding environment used in research software development and data science projects.

## Course objectives

By the end of this workshop you will be able to:

1. Describe what Markdown is and why it is useful
2. Recognise the main components of a Markdown document
3. Use basic Markdown syntax
4. Generate Markdown documents using R/RStudio

## Pre-requisite knowledge

You are not expected to be familiar with either the Markdown language or creating Markdown documents in R prior to attending this workshop. You are also not required to be an advanced user of R. However, a basic working knowledge of R programming is beneficial. As such, you are encouraged to work through our [Introduction to R course content](introduction_to_r.md) (either by attending the course or *via* independent self-study) prior to attending this particular workshop.
