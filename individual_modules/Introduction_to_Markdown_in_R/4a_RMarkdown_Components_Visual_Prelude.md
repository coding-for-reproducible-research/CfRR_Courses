# Introduction to Markdown in R

## Components of an RMarkdown document: a visual prelude
So far we have installed the `rmarkdown` package for producing markdown documents in R, and used it to initialise a blank RMarkdown document. It is worthwhile noting that, whereas standard markdown files hold the `.md` file extention, raw RMarkdown documents instead carry the `.Rmd` file extension. 

### What does a complete RMarkdown document look like?
Adding contents to a raw RMarkdown file will ultimately lead to something in the RStudio window that looks like the following:

### What are the main components of an RMarkdown document?
The above image provides a snapshot of the core components that make up an RMarkdown document, namely:

1. The YAML header
2. Formatted plain text
3. Embedded code

We will explore each of these further during the course of this workshop.
