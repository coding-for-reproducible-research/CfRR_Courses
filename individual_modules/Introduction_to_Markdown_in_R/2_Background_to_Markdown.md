# Introduction to Markdown in R

## A general background to 'Markdown'

### What is Markdown?
Markdown is a special type of language that can be used to create formatted text within a text editor. The concept of Markdown was itself created by John Gruber in 2004. It is designed to be easy to read and write, using plain text formatting that can be converted into structally valid HTML outputs well as other output file formats (e.g. PDF, Microsoft Word, etc). Unlike programming languages which execute commands, Markdown is used to define the appearance and structure of text. It has a dedicated set of annotation sytnax (e.g. symbols) that act as text formatting instructions, such as to establish headers, bolden text, add hyperlinks and create lists. These annotations do not appear in the final document but determine how content is displayed.
