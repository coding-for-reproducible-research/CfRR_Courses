# Introduction to Markdown in R

## A general background to 'Markdown'

### What is Markdown?
Markdown is a special type of language that can be used to create formatted text within a text editor. The concept of Markdown was created by John Gruber in 2004. Unlike programming languages which execute commands, Markdown is used to define the appearance and structure of text. It has a dedicated set of annotation sytnax (e.g. symbols) that can be used to control the formatting of text, from defining headers and boldening words, to adding hyperlinks and creating lists. While the annotation syntax is visible in the Markdown document itself, it does not actually show up in the outputted version of the document. Instead, the annotation syntax gets processed as instructions that dictate how the output content is displayed.

### Why use Markdown?

Markdown offers several broad advantages, such as:
