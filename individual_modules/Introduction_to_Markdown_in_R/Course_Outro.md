# Summary

## Final take-homes

- The Markdown language is a useful tool for altering the format and structure of plain text
- Markdown is best implemented in R *via* RStudio using the `rmarkdown` R package
- R Markdown documents permit dynamic integration of formatted plain text, R code and its outputs, in turn supporting reproducible software development, data analysis and workflows
