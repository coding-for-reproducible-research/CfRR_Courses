# Introduction to Markdown in R

## Course overview

### About this course
Reproducibility is a core feature of successful research software development and data science projects. Fully reproducable workflows can be created by integrating data with code and outputs using a special type of text language called "markdown". This course will introduce you to the markdown langauge and conceptualise the benefits towards ensuring reproducibility in coding-based research activities.You will also gain hands-on experience of creating reproducible workflows with markdown using R: a popular coding environment used in research software development and data science projects.

### Learning outcomes
By the end of this workshop you will be able to:
1. Describe what markdown is and why it is useful
2. Recognise the main components of a markdown document
3. Use basic markdown syntax
4. Generate markdown documents using R/RStudio

### Pre-requisites

#### Software:
This workshop requires you to bring a laptop with both the R and RStudio Desktop software installed. The R software can be downloaded from [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/). The R Studio Desktop software can be downloaded from [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Please make sure to download and install the correct distributions of R and RStudio as per your operating system. Please do also try to install both R and RStudio on your laptop ahead of session so that we can proceed with the workshop content in a timely manner.

#### Knowledge:
You are not expected to be familiar with either the markdown language or creating markdown documents in R prior to attending this workshop. You are also not required to be an advanced user of R. However, a basic working knowledge of R programming is beneficial. As such, you are encouraged to work through our *Introduction to R* course content (either via attending the course or independent self-study) prior to attending this particular workshop. The *Introduction to R* course content is available [here](https://coding-for-reproducible-research.github.io/CfRR_Courses/individual_modules/section_landing_pages/introduction_to_r.html#).
