    "## Command line tools \n",
    "\n",
    "The example job submission script below uses a command line tool called (plink)[https://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/index.shtml] which is used in the analysis of genetic data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The components are the script are \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The SLURM commands to tell the scheduler the parameters for the job, including which queue to submit to, how many processors to use, which project, and the paths to the output/log files. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Load the relevant modules. When the job gets transferred to the compute nodes, the environment is empty. As part of your job you need to load all the relevant software via the module loading system. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The command(s). In this example we are just asking the plink programme to print the help pages.\n",

    "## Python example\n",
    "\n",
    "We need two scripts \n",
    "\n",
    "1) a Python script that contains all the python commands we want to run. This needs to be complete and run from top to bottom with no errors or user input. It should include all data loading, module loading, and saving of any output.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) a job submission script that executes the Python script\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `module load Python/3.10.4-GCCcore-11.3.0` We need this to load Python and specifically version 3 from the list of modules. Without it there is no Python programme to interpret our Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `python calc-squares.py` This is our bash command saying execute the commands in our script with python.\n",
