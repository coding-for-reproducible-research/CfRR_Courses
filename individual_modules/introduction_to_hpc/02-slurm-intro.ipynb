    "# Running a job on a HPC system\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Understand the role of a job scheduler in an HPC system\n",
    "- Learn how to submit a job to the cluster using the `sbatch` command\n",
    "- Monitor and track the status of submitted jobs using command-line tools\n",
    "- Identify common issues and troubleshoot errors in job submission\n",
    "- Explore different jobs queues and resource request for efficient job scheduling \n",
    "\n",
    "## Job Scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduler used on ISCA is Slurm. Slurm is widely used, although cloud based HPC systems are more likely to have\n",
    "proprietary scheduler systems. However, the concepts remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running a Batch Job\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic use of the scheduler is to run a command non-interactively. Any command (or series of commands) that you want to run on the cluster is called a job, and the process of using a scheduler to run the job is called batch job submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### An example job submission script 'hello-world-submission.sh'\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "#!/bin/sh\n",
    "#SBATCH --export=ALL # export all environment variables to the batch job.\n",
    "#SBATCH -p sq # submit to the serial queue\n",
    "#SBATCH --time=00:10:00 # Maximum wall time for the job.\n",
    "#SBATCH -A Research_Project-HPC-Training # research project to submit under. \n",
    "#SBATCH --nodes=1 # specify number of nodes.\n",
    "#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=16 # specify number of processors per node\n",
    "#SBATCH --mail-type=END # send email at job completion \n",
    "#SBATCH --output=hello-world.o\n",
    "#SBATCH --error=hello-world.e\n",
    "#SBATCH --job-name=hello-world\n",
    "\n",
    "## print start date and time\n",
    "echo Job started on:\n",
    "date -u\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"hello-world\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## print node job run on\n",
    "echo -n \"This script is running on \"\n",
    "hostname\n",
    "\n",
    "## print end date and time\n",
    "echo Job ended on:\n",
    "date -u\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We submit this job by running `sbatch hello-world-submission.sh`. This creates a job which will run the script when dispatched to a compute node which the queuing system has identified as being available to perform the work. \n",
    "\n",
    "The output looks like - \n",
    "\n",
    "![](fig/job-submission.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "If you didn't get this output then the job scheduler didn't recognize your script as a job submission script. You might get an error message to help you debug why.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Incorrect line breaks.** As shown in the figure below, a common error if you work on a unix machine is the incorrect **E**nd **o**f **l**ine (EOL) characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](fig/line-breaks-error.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As the job scheduler is running on UNIX system, it is expecting your script to be formatted with UNIX characters. If you were to open your script in a text editor you likely wouldn't be able to see the problem, but the subtle difference between Windows (DOS) and UNIX in how the end of a line is coded causes an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Script not recognised as a job submission.** You can't submit your job to the queue if the scheduler does not recognise the commands in your script as instructions. In this case you will get the error shown in the figure below stating that the job submission has failed. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](fig/sbatch-error.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that either you did not include the SLURM commands or you did not include commands recognised by the scheduler running on the system you are using. Note that the error message refers to \"No partition specified\" this is just a alternative term for a queue on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tracking the job\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you see the \"Job submitted\" output you know that your job submission script has been accepted and the scheduler takes over and tries to run the job for us. This is important to note as it helps you debug any other errors you may or may not get. While the job is waiting to run, it goes into a list of jobs called the queue. To check on our job’s status, we check the queue using the command `squeue -u <yourUsername>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](fig/squeue.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can track our job in the output above, either by it's name or job ID. We can see here that it's currently being held in the queue (status = \"PD\"), once a resource becomes available this will change to an \"R\" to indicate that it is running. In this example, the job is being held in the queue, because the user already has their max allocation of jobs running on the system. In this case, the fair usage policy is preventing their job from running, rather than other users filling up the system. Now it's possible that your script has been run before you get a chance to monitor it, you should however receive an e-mail telling you that your job has finished and whether it was COMPLETED (i.e. ran without error) or FAILED (terminated due to an error.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you recall, when we run our script on the login node, the output was printed to the terminal – but now, when `squeue` shows the job has finished, nothing was printed to the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we submitted our job to the cluster we told it where to redirect the output. The relevant SLURM commands were \n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "#SBATCH --output=hello-world.o\n",
    "#SBATCH --error=hello-world.e\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the content of those files - they should be located in the same folder as you launched the job from. \n",
    "\n",
    "First hello-world.o\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash \n",
    "Job started on:\n",
    "Tue Dec 13 20:04:32 UTC 2022\n",
    "hello-world\n",
    "This script is running on comp088\n",
    "Job ended on:\n",
    "Tue Dec 13 20:04:32 UTC 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This file contains all the standard output, i.e. the messages that would have been printed to the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next hello-world.e\n",
    "\n",
    "This file is empty. This files contains the standard error i.e. the error messages. Ours is empty as our job submission ran without error. \n",
    "\n",
    "The default of the scheduler is to combine this output into a single file with the filename: slurm-%j.out, where %j is the job number. You can change the location of these files by specifying a path to where you want them (using either a relative or absolute path).\n",
    "\n",
    "### More troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "If you successfully submitted your job to the queue but you can't see it in the queue, chances are there is an error in the script and it was queued, started and hit and error before you could load the status of the queue. This should be confirmed by the arrival of an e-mail in you inbox where the job is stated as FAILED. Of course even if you can see it in the queue and it's status is listed as R there is no guarantee that it will \"complete\". When a job finishes prematurely or FAILs we need to try and work out why. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this situation, the two output files are your main sources. Naively we might assume that the error output is the where the answer will be - and yes the error message can be found in that file. But often the error message passed to the processor can be written in unfamiliar terminology. You may find that the output file can help you identify where the script the error must have occurred, as you got some of the output you were expecting, or the function/command printed a more helpful and interpretable message prior to issues the error message to the error output. The content of both these files is sometimes needed to determine first, where in the script the error occured and second, what might have caused it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some common errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Incorrect filepath.** This is likely to involve a statement somewhere like \"File/directory XXX does not exist\" or \"Can't find XXX\" or \"XXX not found\". This means you have incorrectly specified the location of the file/directory the programme is expecting to find or create. It means that you either are running the command from a different place that you thought, and hence a relative path is incorrect, or you have incorrectly specified the path to the file (maybe due to a typo). This can be confirmed with a simple `ls <\\path\\to\\where\\you\\thought\\the\\file\\was>`\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Can't find command X.** AS well as finding the files and directorys, the compute node needs to be able to locate the programme or executable you want to run. You may get an error like, `-bash: plink: command not found`. This means that it could not find the programme \"plink\". This could be because you haven't loaded it into your environment. You've misspelt it  (remember it is case sensitive), the file path is incorrect and it's not available at one of the locations listed in `echo $PATH` or it's file permissions are not set to run it as an executable. Assuming you own the execitable you can change the permissions with `chmod a+x <path\\to\\executable>`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Run out of memory.** With experience (and/or google) you may start to recognise that \"OOM\" stands for out of memory. Anything error with the work \"Killed\" in indicates that you asked too much of the compute resources you requested and to protect the rest of the system your job was shut down. Options here are to a) request more resource b) use the high memory nodes or c) restructure your analysis to reduce the memory load.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Exceeded walltime.** If you job needed 10 hours and you only asked for 8 hours, it will run quite happily for the 8 hours and shortly after it will be killed by the scheduler. This is for two reasons, a) the wall time is an important part of how the scheduler decides which job to run next and b) it's a protective measure to prevent broken, infinite jobs clogging the system up. Other jobs on the node will be unaffected. This means that one user cannot mess up the experience of others, the only jobs affected by a mistake in scheduling will be their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute resources on ISCA are partitioned into different queues, which are designed to manage different types of job. As is common with many other HPC systems, there are separate queues depending if your job is a serial job (`sq`) or parallel job (`pq`). There are also test queues (`stq` and `ptq`), which are designed to provide rapid access to test and develop scripts. This is achieved by having a maximum wall time of 1 hour for jobs submitted to these queues. The high memory nodes are also accessed by submitting to a specific queue (`highmem`). This is similarly the case for the gpus (`gpu`). To submit your job to a different queue, you need to change the `-p` flag in your submission script. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also a number of other specialised queues which are reserved for specific projects. Your PI should be able to tell you if these are relevant for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see a full list of all available queues and determine the status of the queues by running the command `sinfo`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resource Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that is absolutely critical when working on an HPC system is specifying the resources required to run a job. This allows the scheduler to find the right time and place to schedule our job. If you do not specify requirements (such as the amount of time you need), you will likely be stuck with your site’s default resources, which is probably not what you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are several key resource requests:\n",
    "\n",
    "--ntasks=<ntasks> or -n <ntasks>: How many CPU cores does your job need, in total?\n",
    "\n",
    "--time <days-hours:minutes:seconds> or -t <days-hours:minutes:seconds>: How much real-world time (walltime) will your job take to run? The <days> part can be omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "--mem=<megabytes>: How much memory on a node does your job need in megabytes? You can also specify gigabytes using by adding a little “g” afterwards (example: --mem=5g)\n",
    "\n",
    "--nodes=<nnodes> or -N <nnodes>: How many separate machines does your job need to run on? Note that if you set ntasks to a number greater than what one machine can offer, Slurm will set this value automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that just requesting these resources does not make your job run faster, nor does it necessarily mean that you will consume all of these resources. It only means that these are made available to you. Your job may end up using less memory, or less time, or fewer nodes than you have requested, and it will still run. It’s best if your requests accurately reflect your job’s requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Resource requests are typically binding. If you exceed them, your job will be killed. Let’s use wall time as an example. We will request 1 minute of wall time, and attempt to run a job for two minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "#!/bin/sh\n",
    "#SBATCH --export=ALL # export all environment variables to the batch job.\n",
    "#SBATCH -p sq # submit to the serial queue\n",
    "#SBATCH --time=00:01:00 # Maximum wall time for the job.\n",
    "#SBATCH -A Research_Project-HPC-Training # research project to submit under. \n",
    "#SBATCH --nodes=1 # specify number of nodes.\n",
    "#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=16 # specify number of processors per node\n",
    "#SBATCH --mail-type=END # send email at job completion \n",
    "#SBATCH --output=hello-world.o\n",
    "#SBATCH --error=hello-world.e\n",
    "#SBATCH --job-name=long-job\n",
    "\n",
    "## print start date and time\n",
    "echo Job started on:\n",
    "date -u\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"This script is running on ... \"\n",
    "sleep 240 # time in seconds\n",
    "hostname\n",
    "\n",
    "## print end date and time\n",
    "echo Job ended on:\n",
    "date -u\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit the job and wait for it to finish. Once it is has finished, check the log file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cancelling a Job\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we’ll make a mistake and need to cancel a job. This can be done with the ```scancel``` command. Let’s submit a job and then cancel it using its job number (remember to change the walltime so that it runs long enough for you to cancel it before it is killed!). A clean return of your command prompt indicates that the request to cancel the job was successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Types of Jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, we’ve focused on running jobs in batch mode. Slurm also provides the ability to start an interactive session.\n",
    "\n",
    "` srun --time=12:0:0 --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=16 -p sq -A Research_Project-HPC-Training --pty bash`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then enter our commands as required for example running our `hello-world.sh` shell script.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software packages\n",
    "\n",
    "On a high-performance computing system, it is seldom the case that the software we want to use is available when we log in. It is installed, but we will need to “load” it before it can run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start using individual software packages, however, we should understand the reasoning behind this approach. The three biggest factors are:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ software incompatibilities\n",
    "+ versioning\n",
    "+ dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Software incompatibility is a major headache for programmers. Sometimes the presence (or absence) of a software package will break others that depend on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Listing Available Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "To see available software modules, use `module avail`:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](fig/module-avail.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is will give you a very long list of all software, and all versions, available to load and use. You can scroll through this list to find what you need. You can restrict this list by providing the first few characters of the software you require e.g. `module avail Py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the latest R language interpreter available on ISCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading and Unloading Software\n",
    "\n",
    "To load a software module, use `module load`. In this example we will load Python by typing `module load python`. Note that modules are case sensitive. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this instance we haven't specified a specific version so let's check which one we have loaded. We can do this is two ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will use the command `python --version`, which is a python specific command that can be used on any UNIX system to find out which version of python is used by the command python. We can see in the image below that we have loaded Python3.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we will use the command `module list`, which lists the specific name (and therefore version) of the software we installed. We can see in the image below, that our module load command has in fact loaded 12(!) modules including Python3.9.6. When you load a module it additionally installs any other modules on which it depends.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](fig/module-python.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s try unloading the python package with the command `module unload Python`. We can see in this case we have only removed the specific packages we stated in the command, the other 11 modules that were loaded at the same as dependencies are still loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](fig/module-unload.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to unload everything at once, we could run `module purge` (unloads everything).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](fig/module-purge.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this module loading process happens principally through the manipulation of environment variables like $PATH. There is usually little or no data transfer involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module loading process manipulates other special environment variables as well, including variables that influence where the system looks for software libraries, and sometimes variables which tell commercial software packages where to find license servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module command also restores these shell environment variables to their previous state when a module is unloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the current value of the PATH variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load and unload different versions of your preferred programming language, and see how PATH changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using modules in a batch job\n",
    "\n",
    "## R example\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a job using R we need two scripts: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) an R script that contains all the R commands we want to run. This needs to be complete and run from top to bottom with no errors or user input. It should include all data loading, package loading, and saving of any output.\n",
    "2) a job submission script that executes the R script\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use a short R script that runs a for loop to calculate the squares of a list of numbers. This script is named `calc-squares.R` and can be found in the resources section. The job submission script we will use is below. You should recognise the geenral frameowkr where we have the SLURM commands at the top. There are two important lines that we need to include to run our R script.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `module load R` We need this to load R from the list of modules. Without it there is no R programme to interpret our R script.\n",
    "2. `Rscript calc-squares.R` This is our bash command saying execute the commands in our script with R.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "#!/bin/sh\n",
    "#SBATCH -p training # submit to the serial queue\n",

    "Note that by just using `module load R` we are not specifying a particular version of R. Often this command will load the most up-to-date version as the default, but this of course can change and might not be very reproducible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python example\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a python script is the same as running an R script. Again we need two scripts \n",
    "\n",
    "1) a Python script that contains all the python commands we want to run. This needs to be complete and run from top to bottom with no errors or user input. It should include all data loading, module loading, and saving of any output.\n",
