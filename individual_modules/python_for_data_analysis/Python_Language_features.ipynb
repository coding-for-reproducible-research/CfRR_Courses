    "Good choices of names for modules, variables and functions can help to communicate the purpose, and limitations, of your code. But if you want to share your code, or even come back to it in a few months time, it's worth taking the trouble to include comments and *docstrings*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "A *docstring* is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition. Such a *docstring* becomes the ```__doc__``` special attribute of that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "All modules should normally have *docstrings*, and all functions and classes exported by a module should also have *docstrings*. Public methods (including the ```__init__``` constructor) should also have *docstrings*. A package may be documented in the module *docstring* of the ```__init__.py``` file in the package directory.\n",
