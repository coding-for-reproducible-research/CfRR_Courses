    "# Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Write a loop that applies one or more commands separately to each file in a set of files\n",
    "- Trace the values taken on by a loop variable during executionion of the loop\n",
    "- Explain the difference between a variables name and its value\n",
    "- Explain why spaces and some punctuation characters shouldn't be used in file names\n",
    "- Demonstrate how to see what commands have recently been executed\n",
    "- Re-run recently executed commands without retyping them\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keypoints\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"A `for` loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list.\"\n",
    "- \"Every `for` loop needs a variable to refer to the thing it is currently operating on.\"\n",
    "- \"Use `$name` to expand a variable (i.e., get its value). `${name}` can also be used.\"\n",
    "- \"Do not use spaces, quotes, or wildcard characters such as '*' or '?' in filenames, as it complicates variable expansion.\"\n",
    "- \"Give files consistent names that are easy to match with wildcard patterns to make it easy to select them for looping.\"\n",
    "- \"Use the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them.\"\n",
    "- \"Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to search through the previously entered commands.\"\n",
    "- \"Use `history` to display recent commands, and `![number]` to repeat a command by number.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loops** are a programming construct which allow us to repeat a command or set of commands\n",
    "for each item in a list.\n",
    "As such they are key to productivity improvements through automation.\n",
    "Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the\n",
    "amount of typing required (and hence reduces the number of typing mistakes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have several hundred genome data files named `basilisk.dat`, `minotaur.dat`, and\n",
    "`unicorn.dat`.\n",
    "For this example, we'll use the `exercise-data/creatures` directory which only has three\n",
    "example files,\n",
    "but the principles can be applied to many many more files at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of these files is the same: the common name, classification, and updated date are\n",
    "presented on the first three lines, with DNA sequences on the following lines.\n",
    "Let's look at the files:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ head -n 5 basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to print out the classification for each species, which is given on the second\n",
    "line of each file.\n",
    "For each file, we would need to execute the command `head -n 2` and pipe this to `tail -n 1`.\n",
    "We’ll use a loop to solve this problem, but first let’s look at the general form of a loop,\n",
    "using the pseudo-code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "for thing in list_of_things\n",
    "do\n",
    "    operation_using $thing    # Indentation within the loop is not required, but aids legibility\n",
    "done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and we can apply this to our example like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ for filename in basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat\n",
    "do\n",
    "    head -n 2 $filename | tail -n 1\n",
    "done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CLASSIFICATION: basiliscus vulgaris\n",
    "CLASSIFICATION: bos hominus\n",
    "CLASSIFICATION: equus monoceros\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Follow the Prompt\n",
    "The shell prompt changes from `$` to `>` and back again as we were typing in our loop. The second prompt, `>`, is different to remind us that we haven't finished typing a complete command yet. A semicolon, `;`, can be used to separate two commands written on a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the shell sees the keyword `for`,\n",
    "it knows to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each item in a list.\n",
    "Each time the loop runs (called an iteration), an item in the list is assigned in sequence to\n",
    "the **variable**, and the commands inside the loop are executed, before moving on to\n",
    "the next item in the list.\n",
    "Inside the loop,\n",
    "we call for the variable's value by putting `$` in front of it.\n",
    "The `$` tells the shell interpreter to treat\n",
    "the variable as a variable name and substitute its value in its place,\n",
    "rather than treat it as text or an external command.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the list is three filenames: `basilisk.dat`, `minotaur.dat`, and `unicorn.dat`.\n",
    "Each time the loop iterates, it will assign a file name to the variable `filename`\n",
    "and run the `head` command.\n",
    "The first time through the loop,\n",
    "`$filename` is `basilisk.dat`.\n",
    "The interpreter runs the command `head` on `basilisk.dat`\n",
    "and pipes the first two lines to the `tail` command,\n",
    "which then prints the second line of `basilisk.dat`.\n",
    "For the second iteration, `$filename` becomes\n",
    "`minotaur.dat`. This time, the shell runs `head` on `minotaur.dat`\n",
    "and pipes the first two lines to the `tail` command,\n",
    "which then prints the second line of `minotaur.dat`.\n",
    "For the third iteration, `$filename` becomes\n",
    "`unicorn.dat`, so the shell runs the `head` command on that file,\n",
    "and `tail` on the output of that.\n",
    "Since the list was only three items, the shell exits the `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Same Symbols, Different Meanings\n",
    "Here we see `>` being used as a shell prompt, whereas `>` is also used to redirect output. Similarly, `$` is used as a shell prompt, but, as we saw earlier, it is also used to ask the shell to get the value of a variable.\n",
    "If the *shell* prints `>` or `$` then it expects you to type something, and the symbol is a prompt.\n",
    "If *you* type `>` or `$` yourself, it is an instruction from you that the shell should redirect output or get the value of a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using variables it is also\n",
    "possible to put the names into curly braces to clearly delimit the variable\n",
    "name: `$filename` is equivalent to `${filename}`, but is different from\n",
    "`${file}name`. You may find this notation in other people's programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have called the variable in this loop `filename`\n",
    "in order to make its purpose clearer to human readers.\n",
    "The shell itself doesn't care what the variable is called;\n",
    "if we wrote this loop as:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ for x in basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat\n",
    "do\n",
    "    head -n 2 $x | tail -n 1\n",
    "done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ for temperature in basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat\n",
    "do\n",
    "    head -n 2 $temperature | tail -n 1\n",
    "done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "it would work exactly the same way.\n",
    "*Don't do this.*\n",
    "Programs are only useful if people can understand them,\n",
    "so meaningless names (like `x`) or misleading names (like `temperature`)\n",
    "increase the odds that the program won't do what its readers think it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above examples, the variables (`thing`, `filename`, `x` and `temperature`)\n",
    "could have been given any other name, as long as it is meaningful to both the person\n",
    "writing the code and the person reading it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that loops can be used for other things than filenames, like a list of numbers\n",
    "or a subset of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Write your own loop\n",

    "Let's continue with our example in the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/creatures` directory.\n",
    "Here's a slightly more complicated loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ for filename in *.dat\n",
    "do\n",
    "    echo $filename\n",
    "    head -n 100 $filename | tail -n 20\n",

    "\n",
    "## Spaces in Names\n",
    "Spaces are used to separate the elements of the list that we are going to loop over. If one of those elements contains a space character, we need to surround it with quotes, and do the same thing to our loop variable.\n",

    "We would like to modify each of the files in `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/creatures`,\n",

    "\n",
    "Since she's still learning how to use the shell,\n",
    "she decides to build up the required commands in stages.\n",
    "Her first step is to make sure that she can select the right input files --- remember,\n",
    "these are ones whose names end in 'A' or 'B', rather than 'Z'.\n",
    "Starting from her home directory, Nelle types:\n",

    "## Those Who Know History Can Choose to Repeat It\n",
    "Another way to repeat previous work is to use the `history` command to get a list of the last few hundred commands that have been executed, and then to use `!123` (where '123' is replaced by the command number) to repeat one of those commands. For example, if Nelle types this:\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ history | tail -n 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "456  ls -l NENE0*.txt\n",
    "457  rm stats-NENE01729B.txt.txt\n",
    "458  bash goostats.sh NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt\n",
    "459  ls -l NENE0*.txt\n",
    "460  history\n",
    "```\n",
    "then she can re-run `goostats.sh` on `NENE01729B.txt` simply by typing `!458`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other History Commands\n",
    "There are a number of other shortcut commands for getting at the history.\n",
    "- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> enters a history search mode 'reverse-i-search' and finds the most recent command in your history that matches the text you enter next. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> one or more additional times to search for earlier matches. You can then use the left and right arrow keys to choose that line and edit it then hit <kbd>Return</kbd> to run the command.\n",
    "- `!!` retrieves the immediately preceding command (you may or may not find this more convenient than using <kbd>↑</kbd>)\n",
    "- `!$` retrieves the last word of the last command. That's useful more often than you might expect: after `bash goostats.sh NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt`, you can type `less !$` to look at the file `stats-NENE01729B.txt`, which is quicker than doing <kbd>↑</kbd> and editing the command-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Doing a Dry Run\n",
    "A loop is a way to do many things at once --- or to make many mistakes at once if it does the wrong thing. One way to check what a loop *would* do is to `echo` the commands it would run instead of actually running them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to preview the commands the following loop will execute without actually running those commands:\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ for datafile in *.pdb\n",

    "        echo cat $datafile >> all.pdb\n",
    "done\n",
    "\n",
    "# Version 2\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`````{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "The second version is the one we want to run. This prints to screen everything enclosed in the quote marks, expanding the loop variable name because we have prefixed it with a dollar sign. It also *does not* modify nor create the file `all.pdb`, as the `>>` is treated literally as part of a string rather than as a redirection instruction.\n",
    "The first version appends the output from the command `echo cat $datafile` to the file, `all.pdb`. This file will just contain the list; `cat cubane.pdb`, `cat ethane.pdb`, `cat methane.pdb` etc.\n",
    "Try both versions for yourself to see the output! Be sure to open the `all.pdb` file to view its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "`````\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nested Loops\n",
    "Suppose we want to set up a directory structure to organize some experiments measuring reaction rate constants with different compounds *and* different temperatures.  What would be the result of the following code:\n",
    "``` bash \n",
    "$ for species in cubane ethane methane\n",
    "    do\n",
    "        for temperature in 25 30 37 40\n",
    "            do\n",
    "                mkdir $species-$temperature\n",

    "    done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`````{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "We have a nested loop, i.e. contained within another loop, so for each species in the outer loop, the inner loop (the nested loop) iterates over the list of temperatures, and creates a new directory for each combination.\n",
    "Try running the code for yourself to see which directories are created!\n",
