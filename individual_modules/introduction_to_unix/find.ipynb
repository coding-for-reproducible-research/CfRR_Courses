As a taster, we can find lines that have an 'o' in the second position like this:\n",

The `.` matches a single character (just like `?` in the shell), while the `o` matches an actual 'o'.\n",

    "As we said earlier,\n",
    "the command line's power lies in combining tools.\n",
    "We've seen how to do that with pipes;\n",
    "let's look at another technique.\n",
    "As we just saw,\n",
    "`find . -name \"*.txt\"` gives us a list of all text files in or below the current directory.\n",
    "How can we combine that with `wc -l` to count the lines in all those files?\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way is to put the `find` command inside `$()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash \n",
    "$ wc -l $(find . -name \"*.txt\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  21022 ./writing/LittleWomen.txt\n",
    "     11 ./writing/haiku.txt\n",
    "      5 ./numbers.txt\n",
    "  21038 total\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the shell executes this command,\n",
    "the first thing it does is run whatever is inside the `$()`.\n",
    "It then replaces the `$()` expression with that command's output.\n",
    "Since the output of `find` is the three filenames `./writing/LittleWomen.txt`,\n",
    "`./writing/haiku.txt`, and `./numbers.txt`, the shell constructs the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ wc -l ./writing/LittleWomen.txt ./writing/haiku.txt ./numbers.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which is what we wanted.\n",
    "This expansion is exactly what the shell does when it expands wildcards like `*` and `?`,\n",
    "but lets us use any command we want as our own 'wildcard'.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's very common to use `find` and `grep` together.\n",
    "The first finds files that match a pattern;\n",
    "the second looks for lines inside those files that match another pattern.\n",
    "Here, for example, we can find txt files that contain the word \"searching\"\n",
    "by looking for the string 'searching' in all the `.txt` files in the current directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ grep \"searching\" $(find . -name \"*.txt\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "./writing/LittleWomen.txt:sitting on the top step, affected to be searching for her book, but was\n",
    "./writing/haiku.txt:With searching comes loss\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matching and Subtracting\n",
    "The `-v` option to `grep` inverts pattern matching, so that only lines which do *not* match the pattern are printed. Given that, which of the following commands will find all .dat files in `creatures` except `unicorn.dat`?\n",

    "\n",
    "1. `find creatures -name \"*.dat\" | grep -v unicorn`\n",
    "2. `find creatures -name *.dat | grep -v unicorn`\n",

    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "Option 1. is correct. Putting the match expression in quotes prevents the shell expanding it, so it gets passed to the `find` command.\n",
    "Option 2 is also works in this instance because the shell tries to expand `*.dat` but there are no `*.dat` files in the current directory, so the wildcard expression gets passed to `find`.\n",
    "We first encountered this in Working With Files and Directories Option 3 is incorrect because it searches the contents of the files for lines which do not match 'unicorn', rather than searching the file names.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Binary Files\n",
    "We have focused exclusively on finding patterns in text files. What if your data is stored as images, in databases, or in some other format?\n",
    "A handful of tools extend `grep` to handle a few non text formats. But a more generalizable approach is to convert the data to text, or extract the text-like elements from the data. On the one hand, it makes simple things easy to do. On the other hand, complex things are usually impossible. For example, it's easy enough to write a program that will extract X and Y dimensions from image files for `grep` to play with, but how would you write something to find values in a spreadsheet whose cells contained formulas?\n",
    "A last option is to recognize that the shell and text processing have their limits, and to use another programming language. When the time comes to do this, don't be too hard on the shell: many modern programming languages have borrowed a lot of ideas from it, and imitation is also the sincerest form of praise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Unix shell is older than most of the people who use it. It has\n",
    "survived so long because it is one of the most productive programming\n",
    "environments ever created --- maybe even *the* most productive. Its syntax\n",
    "may be cryptic, but people who have mastered it can experiment with\n",
    "different commands interactively, then use what they have learned to\n",
    "automate their work. Graphical user interfaces may be easier to use at\n",
    "first, but once learned, the productivity in the shell is unbeatable.\n",
    "And as Alfred North Whitehead wrote in 1911, 'Civilization advances by\n",
    "extending the number of important operations which we can perform\n",
    "without thinking about them.'\n",
