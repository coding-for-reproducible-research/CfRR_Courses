    "## Learning Objectives \n",
    "- Redirect a command output to a file\n",
    "- Construct command pipelines with two or more stages\n",
    "- Explain what usually happens if a program or pipeline isn't given any input to process\n",
    "- Explain the advantage of linking commands with pipes and filters\n",
    "- Use basic UNIX shell commands to manipulate files and their content using pipes and filters\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keypoints\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"`wc` counts lines, words, and characters in its inputs.\"\n",
    "- \"`cat` displays the contents of its inputs.\"\n",
    "- \"`sort` sorts its inputs.\"\n",
    "- \"`head` displays the first 10 lines of its input.\"\n",
    "- \"`tail` displays the last 10 lines of its input.\"\n",
    "- \"`command > [file]` redirects a command's output to a file (overwriting any existing content).\"\n",
    "- \"`command >> [file]` appends a command's output to a file.\"\n",
    "- \"`[first] | [second]` is a pipeline: the output of the first command is used as the input to the second.\"\n",

    "we can finally look at the shell's most powerful feature:\n",
    "the ease with which it lets us combine existing programs in new ways.\n",
    "We'll start with the directory `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/proteins`\n",
    "that contains six files describing some simple organic molecules.\n",
    "The `.pdb` extension indicates that these files are in Protein Data Bank format,\n",
    "a simple text format that specifies the type and position of each atom in the molecule.\n",

    "## Why Isn't It Doing Anything?\n",
    "What happens if a command is supposed to process a file, but we don't give it a filename? For example, what if we type:\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ wc -l\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "but don't type `*.pdb` (or anything else) after the command? Since it doesn't have any filenames, `wc` assumes it is supposed to process input given at the command prompt, so it just sits there and waits for us to give it some data interactively. From the outside, though, all we see is it sitting there: the command doesn't appear to do anything.\n",
    "If you make this kind of mistake, you can escape out of this state by holding down the control key (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>) and typing the letter <kbd>C</kbd> once and letting go of the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key.\n",
    "This whole action is denoted by <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Capturing output from commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of these files contains the fewest lines?\n",
    "It's an easy question to answer when there are only six files,\n",
    "but what if there were 6000?\n",
    "Our first step toward a solution is to run the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ wc -l *.pdb > lengths.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The greater than symbol, `>`, tells the shell to **redirect** the command's output\n",
    "to a file instead of printing it to the screen. (This is why there is no screen output:\n",
    "everything that `wc` would have printed has gone into the\n",
    "file `lengths.txt` instead.)  The shell will create\n",
    "the file if it doesn't exist. If the file exists, it will be\n",
    "silently overwritten, which may lead to data loss and thus requires\n",
    "some caution.\n",
    "`ls lengths.txt` confirms that the file exists:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ ls lengths.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "lengths.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now send the content of `lengths.txt` to the screen using `cat lengths.txt`.\n",
    "The `cat` command gets its name from 'concatenate' i.e. join together,\n",
    "and it prints the contents of files one after another.\n",
    "There's only one file in this case,\n",
    "so `cat` just shows us what it contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ cat lengths.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  20  cubane.pdb\n",

    "  30  octane.pdb\n",
    "  21  pentane.pdb\n",
    "  15  propane.pdb\n",
    " 107  total\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Page by Page\n",
    "We'll continue to use `cat` in this lesson, for convenience and consistency, but it has the disadvantage that it always dumps the whole file onto your screen. More useful in practice is the command `less`, which you use with `less lengths.txt`. This displays a screenful of the file, and then stops. You can go forward one screenful by pressing the spacebar, or back one by pressing `b`.  Press `q` to quit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Filtering output\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll use the `sort` command to sort the contents of the `lengths.txt` file.\n",

    "\n",
    "`````{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "The `-n` option specifies a numerical rather than an alphanumerical sort.\n",
    "`````\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also use the `-n` option to specify that the sort is\n",
    "numerical instead of alphanumerical.\n",
    "This does *not* change the file;\n",
    "instead, it sends the sorted result to the screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ sort -n lengths.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    " 20  cubane.pdb\n",
    " 21  pentane.pdb\n",
    " 30  octane.pdb\n",
    "107  total\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can put the sorted list of lines in another temporary file called `sorted-lengths.txt`\n",
    "by putting `> sorted-lengths.txt` after the command,\n",
    "just as we used `> lengths.txt` to put the output of `wc` into `lengths.txt`.\n",
    "Once we've done that,\n",
    "we can run another command called `head` to get the first few lines in `sorted-lengths.txt`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ sort -n lengths.txt > sorted-lengths.txt\n",
    "$ head -n 1 sorted-lengths.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  9  methane.pdb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `-n 1` with `head` tells it that\n",
    "we only want the first line of the file;\n",
    "`-n 20` would get the first 20,\n",
    "and so on.\n",
    "Since `sorted-lengths.txt` contains the lengths of our files ordered from least to greatest,\n",
    "the output of `head` must be the file with the fewest lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Redirecting to the same file\n",
    "It's a very bad idea to try redirecting the output of a command that operates on a file to the same file. For example:\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ sort -n lengths.txt > lengths.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "Doing something like this may give you incorrect results and/or delete the contents of `lengths.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Does `>>` Mean?\n",
    "We have seen the use of `>`, but there is a similar operator `>>` which works slightly differently. We'll learn about the differences between these two operators by printing some strings. We can use the `echo` command to print strings e.g.\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ echo The echo command prints text\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The echo command prints text\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now test the commands below to reveal the difference between the two operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ echo hello > testfile01.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and:\n",

    "\n",
    "`````{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "In the first example with `>`, the string 'hello' is written to `testfile01.txt`, but the file gets overwritten each time we run the command. We see from the second example that the `>>` operator also writes 'hello' to a file (in this case`testfile02.txt`), but appends the string to the file if it already exists (i.e. when we run it for the second time).\n",
    "\n",
    "`````\n",
    "\n",
    "## Appending Data\n",
    "We have already met the `head` command, which prints lines from the start of a file. `tail` is similar, but prints lines from the end of a file instead.\n",
    "Consider the file `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/animal-counts/animals.csv`. After these commands, select the answer that corresponds to the file `animals-subset.csv`:\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ head -n 3 animals.csv > animals-subset.csv\n",
    "$ tail -n 2 animals.csv >> animals-subset.csv\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first three lines of `animals.csv`\n",
    "2. The last two lines of `animals.csv`\n",
    "3. The first three lines and the last two lines of `animals.csv`\n",
    "4. The second and third lines of `animals.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "`````{admonition} Solution\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "Option 3 is correct.\n",
    "For option 1 to be correct we would only run the `head` command.\n",
    "For option 2 to be correct we would only run the `tail` command.\n",
    "For option 4 to be correct we would have to pipe the output of `head` into `tail -n 2` by doing `head -n 3 animals.csv | tail -n 2 > animals-subset.csv`\n",
    "`````\n",
    "\n",
    "## Passing output to another command\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example of finding the file with the fewest lines,\n",
    "we are using two intermediate files `lengths.txt` and `sorted-lengths.txt` to store output.\n",
    "This is a confusing way to work because\n",
    "even once you understand what `wc`, `sort`, and `head` do,\n",
    "those intermediate files make it hard to follow what's going on.\n",
    "We can make it easier to understand by running `sort` and `head` together:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ sort -n lengths.txt | head -n 1\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The vertical bar, `|`, between the two commands is called a **pipe**.\n",
    "It tells the shell that we want to use\n",
    "the output of the command on the left\n",
    "as the input to the command on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has removed the need for the `sorted-lengths.txt` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combining multiple commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing prevents us from chaining pipes consecutively.\n",
    "We can for example send the output of `wc` directly to `sort`,\n",
    "and then the resulting output to `head`.\n",
    "This removes the need for any intermediate files.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by using a pipe to send the output of `wc` to `sort`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "  21 pentane.pdb\n",
    "  30 octane.pdb\n",
    " 107 total\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then send that output through another pipe, to `head`, so that the full pipeline becomes:\n",

    "\n",

    "   9  methane.pdb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly like a mathematician nesting functions like *log(3x)*\n",
    "and saying 'the log of three times *x*'.\n",
    "In our case,\n",
    "the calculation is 'head of sort of line count of `*.pdb`'.\n",

    "The redirection and pipes used in the last few commands are illustrated below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Redirects and Pipes of different commands: \"wc -l *.pdb\" will direct the\n",
    "output to the shell. \"wc -l *.pdb > lengths\" will direct output to the file\n",

    "\n",
    "## Tools designed to work together\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea of linking programs together is why Unix has been so successful.\n",
    "Instead of creating enormous programs that try to do many different things,\n",
    "Unix programmers focus on creating lots of simple tools that each do one job well,\n",
    "and that work well with each other.\n",
    "This programming model is called 'pipes and filters'.\n",
    "We've already seen pipes;\n",
    "a **filter** is a program like `wc` or `sort`\n",
    "that transforms a stream of input into a stream of output.\n",
    "Almost all of the standard Unix tools can work this way:\n",
    "unless told to do otherwise,\n",
    "they read from standard input,\n",
    "do something with what they've read,\n",
    "and write to standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is that any program that reads lines of text from standard input\n",
    "and writes lines of text to standard output\n",
    "can be combined with every other program that behaves this way as well.\n",
