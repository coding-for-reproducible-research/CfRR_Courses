    "- Delete, copy, and move specified files and/or directories\n",
    "- Use appropriate naming conventions for files and directories \n",
    "- Utilize basic UNIX shell commands to create, move, and manage files and directories \n",

    "\n",
    "- \"`cp [old] [new]` copies a file.\"\n",
    "- \"`mkdir [path]` creates a new directory.\"\n",
    "- \"`mv [old] [new]` moves (renames) a file or directory.\"\n",
    "- \"`rm [path]` removes (deletes) a file.\"\n",
    "- \"`*` matches zero or more characters in a filename, so `*.txt` matches all files ending in `.txt`.\"\n",
    "- \"`?` matches any single character in a filename, so `?.txt` matches `a.txt` but not `any.txt`.\"\n",

    "## Creating directories\n",
    "\n",
    "We now know how to explore files and directories,\n",
    "but how do we create them in the first place?\n",
    "\n",

    "### Step one: see where we are and what we already have\n",
    "\n",
    "We should still be in the `shell-lesson-data` directory on the Desktop,\n",
    "which we can check using:\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll move to the `exercise-data/writing` directory and see what it contains:\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ cd exercise-data/writing/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ ls -F\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "haiku.txt  LittleWomen.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a new directory called `thesis` using the command `mkdir thesis`\n",
    "(which has no output):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ mkdir thesis\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might guess from its name,\n",
    "`mkdir` means 'make directory'.\n",
    "Since `thesis` is a relative path\n",
    "(i.e., does not have a leading slash, like `/what/ever/thesis`),\n",
    "the new directory is created in the current working directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ ls -F\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "haiku.txt  LittleWomen.txt  thesis/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we've just created the `thesis` directory, there's nothing in it yet:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ ls -F thesis\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `mkdir` is not limited to creating single directories one at a time.\n",
    "The `-p` option allows `mkdir` to create a directory with nested subdirectories\n",
    "in a single operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ mkdir -p ../project/data ../project/results\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-R` option to the `ls` command will list all nested subdirectories within a directory.\n",
    "Let's use `ls -FR` to recursively list the new directory hierarchy we just created in the\n",

    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ ls -FR ../project\n",

    "\n",
    "../project/results:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two ways of doing the same thing\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the shell to create a directory is no different than using a file explorer. If you open the current directory using your operating system's graphical file explorer, the `thesis` directory will appear there too. While the shell and the file explorer are two different ways of interacting with the files, the files and directories themselves are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Good names for files and directories\n",
    "Complicated names of files and directories can make your life painful when working on the command line. Here we provide a few useful tips for the names of your files and directories.\n",
    "1. Don't use spaces.\n",
    "Spaces can make a name more meaningful, but since spaces are used to separate arguments on the command line it is better to avoid them in names of files and directories. You can use `-` or `_` instead (e.g. `north-pacific-gyre/` rather than `north pacific gyre/`). To test this out, try typing `mkdir north pacific gyre`and see what directory (or directories!) are made when you check with `ls -F`.\n",
    "2. Don't begin the name with `-` (dash). Commands treat names starting with `-` as options.\n",
    "3. Stick with letters, numbers, `.` (period or 'full stop'), `-` (dash) and `_` (underscore). Many other characters have special meanings on the command line. We will learn about some of these during this lesson. There are special characters that can cause your command to not work as expected and can even result in data loss.\n",
    "If you need to refer to names of files or directories that have spaces or other special characters, you should surround the name in quotes (`\"\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a text file\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's change our working directory to `thesis` using `cd`,\n",
    "then run a text editor called Nano to create a file called `draft.txt`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ cd thesis\n",
    "$ nano draft.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Which Editor?\n",
    "When we say, '`nano` is a text editor' we really do mean 'text': it can only work with plain character data, not tables, images, or any other human-friendly media. We use it in examples because it is one of the least complex text editors. However, because of this trait, it may not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and macOS), many programmers use [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) or [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) (both of which require more time to learn), or a graphical editor such as [Gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/). On Windows, you may wish to use [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).  Windows also has a built-in editor called `notepad` that can be run from the command line in the same way as `nano` for the purposes of this lesson.\n",
    "No matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it searches for and saves files. If you start it from the shell, it will (probably) use your current working directory as its default location. If you use your computer's start menu, it may want to save files in your desktop or documents directory instead. You can change this by navigating to another directory the first time you 'Save As...'\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's type in a few lines of text. Once we're happy with our text, we can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> (press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd> key and, while holding it down, press the <kbd>O</kbd> key) to write our data to disk (we'll be asked what file we want to save this to: press <kbd>Return</kbd> to accept the suggested default of `draft.txt`).\n",
    "\n",
    "![screenshot of nano text editor in action](fig/nano-screenshot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our file is saved, we can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to quit the editor and\n",
    "return to the shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Control, Ctrl, or ^ Key\n",
    "The Control key is also called the 'Ctrl' key. There are various ways in which using the Control key may be described. For example, you may see an instruction to press the <kbd>Control</kbd> key and, while holding it down, press the <kbd>X</kbd> key, described as any of:\n",
    "* `Control-X`\n",
    "* `Control+X`\n",
    "* `Ctrl-X`\n",
    "* `Ctrl+X`\n",
    "* `^X`\n",
    "* `C-x`\n",
    "\n",
    "In nano, along the bottom of the screen you'll see `^G Get Help ^O WriteOut`. This means that you can use `Control-G` to get help and `Control-O` to save your file.\n",
    "\n",
    "`nano` doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits,\n",
    "but `ls` now shows that we have created a file called `draft.txt`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "draft.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Files a Different Way\n",
    "We have seen how to create text files using the `nano` editor. Now, try the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ touch my_file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. What did the `touch` command do? When you look at your current directory using the GUI file explorer, does the file show up?\n",
    "2. Use `ls -l` to inspect the files.  How large is `my_file.txt`?\n",
    "3. When might you want to create a file this way?\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "1. The `touch` command generates a new file called `my_file.txt` in your current directory.  You can observe this newly generated file by typing `ls` at the command line prompt.  `my_file.txt` can also be viewed in your GUI file explorer.\n",
    "2. When you inspect the file with `ls -l`, note that the size of `my_file.txt` is 0 bytes.  In other words, it contains no data. If you open `my_file.txt` using your text editor it is blank.\n",
    "3. Some programs do not generate output files themselves, but instead require that empty files have already been generated. When the program is run, it searches for an existing file to populate with its output.  The touch command allows you to efficiently generate a blank text file to be used by such programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid confusion later on,\n",
    "we suggest removing the file you've just created before proceeding with the rest\n",
    "of the episode, otherwise future outputs may vary from those given in the lesson.\n",
    "To do this, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ rm my_file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's In A Name?\n",
    "You may have noticed that all of Nelle's files are named 'something dot something', and in this part of the lesson, we always used the extension `.txt`.  This is just a convention: we can call a file `mythesis` or almost anything else we want. However, most people use two-part names most of the time to help them (and their programs) tell different kinds of files apart. The second part of such a name is called the **filename extension** and indicates what type of data the file holds: `.txt` signals a plain text file, `.pdf` indicates a PDF document, `.cfg` is a configuration file full of parameters for some program or other, `.png` is a PNG image, and so on.\n",
    "This is just a convention, albeit an important one. Files contain bytes: it's up to us and our programs to interpret those bytes according to the rules for plain text files, PDF documents, configuration files, images, and so on.\n",
    "Naming a PNG image of a whale as `whale.mp3` doesn't somehow magically turn it into a recording of whale song, though it *might* cause the operating system to try to open it with a music player when someone double-clicks it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Moving files and directories\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing` directory,\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In our `thesis` directory we have a file `draft.txt`\n",
    "which isn't a particularly informative name,\n",
    "so let's change the file's name using `mv`,\n",
    "which is short for 'move':\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument tells `mv` what we're 'moving',\n",
    "while the second is where it's to go.\n",
    "In this case,\n",
    "we're moving `thesis/draft.txt` to `thesis/quotes.txt`,\n",
    "which has the same effect as renaming the file.\n",
    "Sure enough,\n",
    "`ls` shows us that `thesis` now contains one file called `quotes.txt`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ ls thesis\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "quotes.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One must be careful when specifying the target file name, since `mv` will\n",
    "silently overwrite any existing file with the same name, which could\n",
    "lead to data loss. An additional option, `mv -i` (or `mv --interactive`),\n",
    "can be used to make `mv` ask you for confirmation before overwriting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `mv` also works on directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's move `quotes.txt` into the current working directory.\n",
    "We use `mv` once again,\n",
    "but this time we'll use just the name of a directory as the second argument\n",
    "to tell `mv` that we want to keep the filename\n",
    "but put the file somewhere new.\n",
    "(This is why the command is called 'move'.)\n",
    "In this case,\n",
    "the directory name we use is the special directory name `.` that we mentioned earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ mv thesis/quotes.txt .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the current working directory.\n",
    "`ls` now shows us that `thesis` is empty:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ ls thesis\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$\n",
    "```\n",

    "Alternatively, we can confirm the file `quotes.txt` is no longer present in the `thesis` directory\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`ls` with a filename or directory as an argument only lists the requested file or directory.\n",
    "If the file given as the argument doesn't exist, the shell returns an error as we saw above.\n",
    "We can use this to see that `quotes.txt` is now present in our current directory:\n",

    "$ ls quotes.txt\n",

Let's consider the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/proteins` directory: `*.pdb` matches `ethane.pdb`, `propane.pdb`, and every file that ends with '.pdb'. On the other hand, `p*.pdb` only matches `pentane.pdb` and `propane.pdb`, because the 'p' at the front only matches filenames that begin with the letter 'p'.\n",
    "`?` is also a wildcard, but it matches exactly one character. So `?ethane.pdb` would match `methane.pdb` whereas `*ethane.pdb` matches both `ethane.pdb`, and `methane.pdb`.\n",
    "Wildcards can be used in combination with each other e.g. `???ane.pdb` matches three characters followed by `ane.pdb`, giving `cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  octane.pdb`.\n",
    "When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a list of matching filenames *before* running the command that was asked for. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command as it is. For example, typing `ls *.pdf` in the `proteins` directory (which contains only files with names ending with `.pdb`) results in an error message that there is no file called `*.pdf`. However, generally commands like `wc` and `ls` see the lists of file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards themselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that deals with expanding wildcards.\n",
