# Exercise 2

Create a Jupyter Notebook that integrates Markdown and Python code to demonstrate a simple data analysis. Your notebook should:

Use Python code to:

- Import at least two packages (e.g. `seaborn`, `pandas`, or `matplotlib`)

- Load a dataset using seaborn (other than `titanic`)
  -  Examples: `iris`, `penguins`, `diamonds`, `tips`, `flights`
  -  Display the first few rows of the dataset
  -  Create and display at least two graphs (e.g. bar plot, scatter plot, histogram)

Use Markdown to include:

- A main heading (`#`) with a title for your notebook
- At least two subheadings (`##`) to structure your content
- A paragraph describing the dataset


Export:
- Save your completed notebook as an HTML file
