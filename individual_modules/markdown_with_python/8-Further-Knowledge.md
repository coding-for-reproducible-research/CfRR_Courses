# Further Knowledge

This section outlines advanced topics and tools that can help you level up your skills in using Markdown with Python in Jupyter Notebooks and beyond.

## Version Control in Dynamic Documents

Using version control systems like Git is essential for tracking changes in your notebooks over time, collaborating with others, and maintaining a history of your work.

## Markdown and LaTeX for Advanced Formatting
Markdown supports LaTeX syntax, allowing you to write clean mathematical expressions:

Inline:
```
$E = mc^2$
```

Block:
```
$$
\frac{a}{b} = c
$$
```

Try it on!

## Using Widgets for Interactivity

`ipywidgets` is a Python library that lets you add interactive elements like sliders, dropdowns, and buttons directly to your notebook. These widgets can dynamically control inputs to your code, making it easier to explore data or model behaviour without rerunning or editing cells.

```
import ipywidgets as widgets
widgets.IntSlider(min=0, max=10, step=1, value=5)
```

## Always remember!
Clear structure, consistent naming, and clean outputs make notebooks easier to share and maintain.
