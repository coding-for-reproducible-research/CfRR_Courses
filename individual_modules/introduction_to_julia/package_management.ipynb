    "# Package Management \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the basics of Julia's package management system \n",
    "- Add (install), remove, and update packages using Julia's package manager\n",
    "- View and manage installed packages (e.g. check the status of the environment) \n",
    "- Import and use installed packages in your Julia code \n",
    "- Identify some common Julia packages and their uses and understand best practices for package management \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of Julia's Package System\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia's package ecosystem provides a wide range of functionality, from data manipulation and plotting to machine learning and beyond. Julia ships with a package manager called [`Pkg`](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/) that is designed to make it easy to install and manage these packages and their dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Pkg` uses a concept called **environments**:\n",
    "- An environment is basically a set of packages and specific versions that you have downloaded to use.\n",
    "- By default, when you use the Julia REPL or Jupyter, you're in the \"default environment\".\n",
    "- However, you can create separate environments for each project you work on, so that you only work with the packages (and versions) needed for that project. The details of the packages and versions are recorded in files `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` that reside in your project folder.\n",
    "- It is **highly recommended** that you use a separate environment for each project you work on, as this greatly enhances the reproducibility of your work.\n",
    "- For the most part, it is best not to install packages into the default environment (apart perhaps from a few select language or development tools, such as `IJulia` for using Julia in Jupyter notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why use project-specific environments?**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> When you install packages into the default environment, you risk version conflicts between projects, as different projects may require different versions of the same package. This can lead to compatibility issues and unexpected behavior. Additionally, installing everything into the default environment makes it harder to track which packages are needed for which projects. Project-specific environments isolate dependencies, ensuring that each project has its own set of packages, which helps in avoiding these problems and makes your development process more reliable and reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files enable Julia to manage and precisely specify environments.\n",
    "- The `Project.toml` file describes the project's requirements at a high level. It plays an important role when developing Julia packages (which we won't cover in this course), where it is also used to include package metadata e.g. authors, version, package compatability constraints etc. For our purposes, `Project.toml` just lists out the direct package dependencies for our project.\n",
    "- The `Manifest.toml` file records the precise state of the environment at a given time, giving a detailed snapshot of the exact versions of all packages within an environment, including their transitive dependencies. It allows us to instantiate an environment with exactly the same packages and versions that somebody else used to run their code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, **in order for someone else to run our code using the same packages and versions that we used, we just need to give them `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` along with our code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the `Pkg` REPL\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to use `Pkg` is through a dedicated REPL built into the Julia REPL. To access it, open the Julia REPL and then enter the 'command' `]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "julia> ]\n",
    "(v1.11) pkg>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that the prompt changes. The REPL opens in the default environment, indicated by the Julia version number (`v1.11` in the above example). There is also the dedicated `pkg>` prompt to indicate we're in the `Pkg` REPL, rather than Julia's normal REPL.\n",
    "\n",
    "To exit back to the regular Julia REPL, just hit <kbd>backspace</kbd> from within the `Pkg` REPL.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see help text for using the `Pkg` REPL, use the `help` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(v1.11) pkg> help\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating / activating an environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a `Pkg` environment is simply a matter of:\n",
    "- Choosing a folder on our file system to associated with the environment. Typically this will be the folder where you are writing your code for some project / application. This is where the associated `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files will reside.\n",
    "- Using the `Pkg` REPL to activate the environment (creating the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's suppose we have a folder `MyProject` where we are writing (or will write) our code. To activate an evironment within `MyProject` we enter the `Pkg` REPL and then call `activate` with the path to the `MyProject` folder (with respect to the directory where we started the Julia REPL):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "julia> ]\n",
    "(v1.11) pkg> activate path/to/MyProject\n",
    "  Activating new project at `path/to/MyProject`\n",
    "\n",
    "(MyProject) pkg>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the prompt now indicates we're working with the environment `MyProject`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: activating a new project will not yet create `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` - these will be created once we start adding packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding and removing packages\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a package to an environment to make it available to use in our code, use the `add` command from within the `Pkg` REPL. E.g. to add the latest version of the `Plots.jl` package to our environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(MyProject) pkg> add Plots\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we don't include the `.jl` suffix!\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia will download the package if required and then add it to the environment. It will also create / update the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we need to install a specific version, we just specify it with an `@` prefix:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(MyProject) pkg> add Plots@1.40.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove a package from the environment, just use the `remove` (or `rm`) command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(MyProject) pkg> remove Plots\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Julia stores packages in a central 'depot' that is shared across environments, to optimise package management and reduce redundant downloads. When you `add` a package, Julia first checks this depot to see if the package (at the specific / latest version) is already available. If the package is found, it is used directly, speeding up the installation process. If the package is not found, Julia downloads it from the internet and stores it in the depot for future use. However, only the packages explicitly `add`ed to an environment are available for use within that environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Listing packages in the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To list the packages within the environment that are direct requirements for the project (i.e. specified in `Project.toml`), use the `status` (or `st`) command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(MyProject) pkg> status\n",
    "Status `path/to/MyProject/Project.toml`\n",
    "  [91a5bcdd] Plots v1.40.13\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To list all packages in the environment (as detailed in the `Manifest.toml`), use the `--manifest` option:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(MyProject) pkg> status --manifest\n",
    "Status `path/to/MyProject/Manifest.toml`\n",
    "  [66dad0bd] AliasTables v1.1.3\n",
    "  [d1d4a3ce] BitFlags v0.1.9\n",
    "  [944b1d66] CodecZlib v0.7.8\n",
    "  [35d6a980] ColorSchemes v3.29.0\n",
    "  [3da002f7] ColorTypes v0.12.1\n",
    "  [c3611d14] ColorVectorSpace v0.11.0\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "  [91a5bcdd] Plots v1.40.13\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "  [-- full output suppressed --]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating packages\n",
    "\n",
    "#### All packages\n",
    "\n",
    "To update all packages within the environment (i.e. all those specified in `Manifest.toml`), use the `update` (or `up`) command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(MyProject) pkg> update\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia will ensure that any version restrictions enforced by dependent packages are maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specific packages\n",
    "\n",
    "To update a specific package, use `update` with the name of the package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(MyProject) pkg> update Plots\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, Julia will ensure that any version restrictions enforced by dependent packages are maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, if you specify a package Julia will **only update that package**, not any other packages that it may depend upon. To allow Julia to update all dependent packages as well, supply the `--preserve=none` option:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(MyProject) pkg> update --preserve=none Plots\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `update` is only used to install later versions. To replace a package with an older version, use `add` and specify the package with the version you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instantiating an environment from `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml`\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a folder `NewProject` where we already have `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files, we can add all the packages specified in these files using the `instantiate` command. Note that we need to ensure we activate the project first:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(v1.11) pkg> activate path/to/NewProject\n",
    "(NewProject) pkg> instantiate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise: an environment with `Plots`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new environment and add the `Plots` package to it.\n",
    "2. List all packages in environment (try with and without the `--manifest` option).\n",
    "3. Take a peek at the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` to see the difference between these files (but don't modify them!)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best practices with packages \n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't modify `Manifest.toml` by hand! Doing so could break Julia's package management capabilities for your project.\n",
    "- When sharing your work with others, make sure to send them the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files so that they can reproduce your environment.\n",
    "- Keep the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files under version control, to track package updates.\n",
    "- If using the `Pkg` API in your code, don't use `Pkg.add` in performance-critical code or inside functions that run repeatedly.\n",
    "- Use `using` or `import` statements at the top of your script/notebook, to make clear what external libraries your code is using. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Julia's Standard Library\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia contains a **standard library** of modules. These are basically just packages that ship with Julia and are ready in any environment (you don't need to `add` them). There are many useful modules, here are just a small selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Pkg`: for doing package management using Julia code e.g. `Pkg.activate(\"MyProject\")`, `Pkg.add(\"Plots\")` etc.\n",
    "- `Dates`: for working with dates and timestamps\n",
    "- `Test`: for unit testing\n",
    "- `DelimitedFiles`: for working with delimited files e.g. CSV.\n",
    "- `LinearAlgebra`: for linear algebra computations\n",
    "- `Logging`: for logging\n",
    "\n",
    "See [the Julia docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using packages in your code\n",
    "\n",
    "Every package defines a **module** of the same name (e.g. the `Plots.jl` pakcage defines the module `Plots`). Modules are Julia's way of namespacing. To use the functionality of a package in your Julia code, you have two primary options: via `using` and `import`. They differ in how they bring names from the module into your namespace:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `using PackageName`: This brings **all exported** names from the `PackageName` module directly into your current scope, as well as `PackageName` itself. You can call those names without qualifying them by the module name. (You can still use the module to qualify the names if you like e.g. `PackageName.do_something()`\n",
    "- `import PackageName`: This makes the module `PackageName` available, but **does not** pull any of its names into your scope. You must qualify everything with the module's name. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, If you wanted to use the Julia standard library `Dates` module, the two approaches would be: "
