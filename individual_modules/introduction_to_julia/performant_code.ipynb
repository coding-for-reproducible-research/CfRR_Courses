    "# Performant Code \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives \n",
    "- Understand basic strategies for writing high-performance Julia code \n",
    "- Learn about type stability and why it's important for performance \n",
    "- Recognise the impact of global variables on performance and how to avoid them \n",
    "- Appreciate the benefit of using built-in functions and vectorised operations for optimisation \n",
    "- Choose appropriate data structures for a task to improve performance \n",
    "- Understand memory management techniques (like avoiding unnecessary copies) to write efficient code \n",
    "- Measure running time and memory allocation of code and identify bottlenecks using simple tools \n",
    "\n",
    "One of Julia's major appeals is performance. You can often write code in Julia that is both high-level and also runs nearly as fast as lower-level languages. However, to fully unlock this performance, it's good to be aware of a few tips and practices. Within this lesson, we are going to introduce some key concepts: type stability, avoiding globals, using efficient approaches, and basic profiling/timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of Performance Tuning Strategies \n",
    "- Performance tuning in Julia often comes down to writing code that is easy for the compiler to optimise, which includes: \n",
    "- Ensuring computations are type-stable: the types of variables don't change unpredictably. \n",
    "- Avoiding global variables in tight loops or computations: use functions to encapsulate logic. \n",
    "- Utilising Julias vectorised (broadcast) operations and built-in functions, which are highly optimised, instead of manually looping in an inefficient way. \n",
    "- Choose the right data structure, e.g. using arrays, tuples, and dictionaries appropriately. \n",
    "- Reducing memory allocations when possible, for example, by modifying data in place or using views for subarrays instead of making copies. \n",
    "- Measuring and profiling to find where the time is actually being spent, so you can optimise where it matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Efficient Julia Code \n",
    "\n",
    "### Type Stability \n",
    "\n",
    "A function is type-stable if the type of its output can be determined from the types of its inputs, **without having to run the function**. This means that you need to: \n",
    "- pass inputs of known types into the function, \n",
    "- the compiler can predict what **type** the result will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a type-stable function: \n",
    "\n",
    "```Julia\n",
    "function add(x::Float64, y::Float64)\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "For the function above:\n",
    "- If you give two `Float64`s, the result is always a `Float64`.\n",
    "- The compiler **knows this immediately**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a type-unstable function: \n",
    "```Julia\n",
    "function maybe_add(x, y)\n",
    "    if rand() > 0.5\n",
    "        return x + y\n",
    "    else\n",
    "        return string(x, y)\n",
    "    end\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Sometimes it returns a **number**, sometimes a **String**. \n",
    "- The compiler **Can't predict** the output type just from the input types. \n",
    "- This forces Julia to **insert expensive type checks** at runtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "This then raises the question of **Does specifying types in function signatures improve performance?** Where the answer is: No, Julia specialises in methods on the concrete types it actually sees, even without annotations. Type annotations in signatures mainly help with dispatch, readability, and documentation; they rarely affect raw speed except in rare corner cases, as discussed within the [Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/#Argument-type-declarations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifying types such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "```Julia \n",
    "function myfun(x::Float64)\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It will not automatically make the code faster. The reason for this is: \n",
    "Julia **compiles specialised versions of functions for the types it sees anyway**, even if you didn't specify types.\n",
    "What matters for performance is **what happens inside the function** - are the types predictable?\n",
    "\n",
    "**You can write a function with no type annotations** but still make it very fast if the output type is **predictable**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rule of thumb is:\n",
    "- Specifying types at the function input is good for readability, documentation, dispatch (method choices)\n",
    "- Type stability inside the function is crucial for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use: \n",
    "```Julia \n",
    "@code_warntype your_function(args)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**An aside on macros**: In Julia, **macros** are special functions that operate on your *code* itself, rather than on the *values* your code produces. They run at **compile** time, transforming expressions before any actual execution happens. That means you can **generate boilerplate** code automatically (e.g. logging) or **inject** or **wrap** user code with additional checks or timings. You invoke a macro by prefixing its name with `@` and then supplying the target expression (often a function call) in parentheses, as done above for `@code_warntype`.\n",

    "`method_0` rebuilds the array with `vcat` on every iteration, causing ~500 000 separate heap allocations and copying 38.7 GiB of data. This allocation and garbage-collection overhead dominates its ≈2.2 s runtime on both runs. `method_1` uses `push!` to grow the array incrementally. Thanks to Julia’s amortised resizing strategy, it only incurs 18 allocations totalling ~1.9 Mib, so it finishes in under 0.2 ms. Running `@time` twice shows that **both methods** pay the JIT compilation cost on their first call, but only `method_0` continues to pay massive allocation and GC costs thereafter, whereas `method_1` remains lightning-fast with negligible heap traffic."

    "### Utilising Built-In Functions\n",
    "Julia's standard library and well-known packages have many optimised routines, which are often implemented in C or using Julia's own optimisations (including multi-threading in some cases). Examples: `sum`, `maximum`, or linear algebra operations (`A * B`) or sorting (`sort`). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Appropriate Data Structures \n",
    "Some key considerations when determining which data structure to use include: \n",
    "- If you need random access to elements by index and the collection will grow/shrink, you require a Vector (`Array`). \n",
    "- If you need to look up values by keys, use a `Dict` instead of searching through an array each time. \n",
    "- If you have a fixed small set of values of heterogenous types, a `Tuple` can be helpful. They are immutable, and their types are part of their identity, making them very efficient for specific uses, like returning multiple values from a function. \n",
    "- If you need stack or queue behaviour, you can still use arrays (with `push!` or `pop!` for the stack and `push!` and `popfirst!` for the queue. \n",
    "- If you have binary data or bits, consider `BitVector` for large boolean arrays that are memory efficient. \n",
    "- For mathematical operations, using native numeric types (`Int`, `Float64`) is faster than arbitrary precisions or rational types, so only use `BigInt`, `BigFloat` and `Rational` when needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory Management and Avoiding Unnecessary Allocation \n",
    "\n",
    "In Julia, **memory allocation** of interest refers primarily to **heap allocation**, when your code requests new blocks of memory at runtime. Each allocation incurs overhead (for bookkeeping) and later increases garbage-collection work, which can slow down loops or large-scale data processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common sources of excessive allocation include **Type-stability issues**, which force Julia to box values on the heap, and **creating many small temporary arrays**, for example via repeated slicing or non-in-place broadcast, as discussed in the [Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#Measure-performance-with-%5B@time%5D(@ref)-and-pay-attention-to-memory-allocation). \n",
    "\n",
    "Some strategies to cut down heap usage include: \n",
    "**Pre-allocate and reuse arrays** instead of building a new array each iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "# Bad: allocates a new array inside the loop\n",
    "results = []\n",
    "for i in 1:1000\n",
    "    push!(results, compute(i))\n",
    "end\n",
    "\n",
    "# Good: allocate once, then fill in place\n",
    "results = Vector{Float64}(undef, 1000)\n",
    "for i in 1:1000\n",
    "    results[i] = compute(i)\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use views for subarrays** `view(A, 1:10)` creates a lightweight window into `A` without copying its data, avoiding a fresh allocation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Favour in-place operations** Functions ending in `!` typically modify their arguments rather than returning new objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "```julia \n",
    "sort!(array)    # rearranges in place\n",
    "push!(arr, x)   # grows the same array\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid repeated type conversions inside loops**. Converting values one by one triggers allocations or passing work on each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "# Bad: parse inside the loop, resulting in repeated allocations\n",
    "for s in string_numbers\n",
    "    x = parse(Int, s)\n",
    "    process(x)\n",
    "end\n",
    "\n",
    "# Good: convert once, then loop\n",
    "ints = parse.(Int, string_numbers)\n",
    "for x in ints\n",
    "    process(x)\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip**: Use `@time` or @BenchmarkTools.@btime` and watch the \"allocations\" count. You will often spot allocations caused by temporary arrays or type-unstable code. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Clever Algorithms / Calculations \n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the most considerable speedups come not from micro-optimising memory, but from ROM choosing better algorithms or mathematical shortcuts. For example, instead of summing the first *N* integers in a loop: \n",
    "\n",
    "```julia \n",
    "function sum1(N)\n",
    "    total = 0\n",
    "    for i in 1:N\n",
    "        total += i\n",
    "    end\n",
    "    return total\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the closed-form formula: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia \n",
    "sum2(N) = N * (N + 1) ÷ 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which runs in constant time rather than being based on the size of the input, and allocates no extra memory. Whenever possible, look for algorithmic improvements or analytic formulas before resorting to low-level optimisations. "
