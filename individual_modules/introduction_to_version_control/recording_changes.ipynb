    "# Recording Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "- Understand the process of recording changes in a Git repository using the `git add` and `git commit` commands.\n",
    "- Learn to check the status of a Git repository using the `git status` command\n",
    "- Comprehend the concept of the modify-add-commit workflow for building a version history in Git\n",
    "- Practice creating and committing new files in a repository\n",
    "- Develop best practices for writing informative commit messages \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Viewing the status of a repository\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we have a new repository, either a clone from a remote repository or a\n",
    "brand new, empty one. It's time to get to work adding content to it. But before\n",
    "we do that, let's cover one of the simplest, yet most useful, Git commands:\n",
    "`git status`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `git status` command gives you information about the current state of work\n",
    "when working with a Git repository. Let's take a look at an example with our recently cloned\n",
    "`git-good-practice` repository. We first need to make sure that we're located\n",
    "in the root folder of the repository. In the example below, this is contained\n",
    "within the parent folder `~/repositories`, so we first change directories with\n",
    "`cd` and remind ourselves of the contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ cd ~/repositories/git-good-practice\n",
    "$ ls\n",
    "README.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently there's just a single readme file. Recall that the `git-good-practice`\n",
    "folder actually also contains the hidden folder `.git`, which we would have also\n",
    "seen if we'd used `ls -a` instead of just plain old `ls`. Now we can check the\n",
    "status of the repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing to commit, working tree clean\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's consider what the output means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first two lines refer to a *branch* called `main`, and how it's up-to-date\n",
    "  with another branch called `origin/main`. For now,\n",
    "  you can regard these lines as saying that our local version of the repository\n",
    "  is in sync with the remote version. (This is not the whole story and\n",
    "  is, at best, a partial truth. We'll uncover more about what this really means later\n",
    "  in the course when we learn about branches more generally.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The line `nothing to commit, working tree clean` is of more immediate interest.\n",
    "  This is Git's way of saying that it hasn't identified any changes to the\n",
    "  contents of the repository ('working tree clean'), so there are no new changes\n",
    "  that could be recorded in the repository's history ('nothing to commit').\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, note that `git status` only gives us information about *changes* to\n",
    "  the contents of the repository. It doesn't spell out the whole contents of\n",
    "  the repository like `ls` would. For example, we know that the repository\n",
    "  contains the file `README.md`, yet it doesn't feature in\n",
    "  the output of `git status` because there aren't any (new) changes to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, you can think of the **working tree** as the contents of the\n",
    "repository, just like you're used to thinking of files within a folder or\n",
    "subfolders. Git is able to detect changes to files in the working tree, including\n",
    "those that are in subfolders of the repository root folder (or sub-subfolders, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run `git status` often\n",
    "We're going to flag here that you should get into the habit of running `git status` often. It's the primary way of seeing at a glance what state your working tree is in and how it differs (or not) with what was last recorded in the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding and committing files\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make some changes to the repository. First, we'll create a new Markdown\n",
    "file called `Git-cheatsheet.md`, for us to record key Git commands as we go.\n",
    "Running `git status` now shows us:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Untracked files:\n",
    "  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n",
    "        Git-cheatsheet.md\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'Untracked files:' bit indicates that Git has spotted a new file which it\n",
    "has no record of. Before going further, let's add some content to the cheatsheet\n",
    "about `git status`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# Git Cheatsheet\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: run commands from within a Git repository*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checking the state of files (do this often!)\n",
    "\n",
    "`git status` — Checks the state of the working tree in a Git repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Markdown syntax\n",
    "* Hash symbols (`#`) are used to denote the document title and headings. One hash `#` denotes the document title, two hashes `##` indicates a section heading, three hashes `###` indicates a sub-heading, etc.\n",
    "* Wrapping text with asterisks (`*`) will emphasise text i.e. set it in italics. You can also wrap the text in underscores (`_`) e.g. `*This* is in italics, so is _this_.`\n",
    "* Wrapping text in backticks (`` ` ``) is used to display code. It won't be formatted like regular text. Compare:\n",
    "    - Wrapped in backticks: `` `foo _bar_` `` renders as `foo _bar_`\n",
    "    - As regular text: `foo _bar_` renders as foo _bar_\n",
    "* Extra spaces and tabs are just treated as a single space. Paragraphs must have a blank line between them to be rendered on different lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "After adding the above text to `Git-cheatsheet.md` file and saving our changes,\n",
    "we now tell Git to start tracking changes to this file by using the `add`\n",
    "command:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git add Git-cheatsheet.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see what `git status` now tells us:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes to be committed:\n",
    "  (use \"git restore --staged <file>...\" to unstage)\n",
    "        new file:   Git-cheatsheet.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between this status and the status before we did `git add` on our\n",
    "cheatsheet is the 'Changes to be committed:' bit. Git has now recognised that\n",
    "it has a new file, called `Git-cheatsheet.md`, to keep track of. It Git parlance,\n",
    "`Git-cheatsheet.md` has become a **tracked** file. But it hasn't\n",
    "yet stored the new version of the file as part of its history. To do that, we\n",

    "\n",
    "Upon entering this command, the text editor we configured for Git earlier springs into life, opening up a file with some pre-defined text and leaving space at the top for us\n",
    "to write in. (The lines preceded by hashes are comments that are ignored by Git.)\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "\n",
    "# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting\n",
    "# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.\n",

    "# Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Changes to be committed:\n",
    "#       new file:   Git-cheatsheet.md\n",
    "#\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, this file is for writing a **commit message**. This is a message\n",
    "that tells people about changes that are being committed to the repository.\n",
    "It should briefly, but clearly, describe the main changes that have been made. We\n",
    "add our commit message at the top of the opened file:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "Create a cheatsheet document\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the document by adding an entry for Git's status command.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting\n",
    "# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# On branch main\n",

    "#       new file:   Git-cheatsheet.md\n",
    "#\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've written our message, we save the document (**don't** change the file\n",
    "name!) and close it. The `git commit` command finishes and we get a little\n",
    "summary message about what was just committed (note the first line of our\n",
    "commit message is included):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git commit\n",
    "[main 17912ce] Create a cheatsheet document\n",
    " 1 file changed, 8 insertions(+)\n",
    " create mode 100644 Git-cheatsheet.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run `git commit`,\n",
    "Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add`\n",
    "and stores a copy permanently inside the special `.git` directory.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Best practice: commit messages\n",
    "<a href=\"https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noreferrer\">Good commit messages</a> start with a brief (usually < 50 characters) statement about the changes made in the commit. Generally, the message should complete the sentence \"If applied, this commit will [_commit message here_]\". If you want to go into more detail, add a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes. Use this additional space to explain why you made changes and/or what their impact will be. Avoid uninformative messages such as \"small tweaks\" or \"updates\" — write what will be useful for others to read (which includes yourself in one year's time).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we now run `git status` again, we get the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.\n",
    "  (use \"git push\" to publish your local commits)\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing to commit, working tree clean\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is now telling us that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are no further changes in the repository to record\n",
    "  ('nothing to commit, working tree clean').\n",
    "\n",
    "* The new version of the repository has been recorded in a commit (\"Your branch\n",
    "  is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.\") The \"ahead of\n",
    "  'origin/main'\" bit indicates that our local repository now has new snapshots\n",
    "  that aren't recorded in the remote repository. We'll discuss this in a later\n",
    "  episode, so just focus on the \"1 commit\" bit for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modify-add-commit\n",
    "\n",
    "The example above alludes to the idea that developing files in Git involves\n",
    "iteratively going round a three step cycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Modify_ the files in your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. _Add_ the changes you want to record.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. _Commit_ these changes to the repository's history.\n",
    "\n",
    "This _modify-add-commit_ cycle is the bread-and-butter of using Git and it will\n",
    "very soon become second nature to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before continuing, we want to mention another piece of terminology relating to\n",
    "the `add` command. In Git parlance, applying `git add` to a file\n",
    "**stages** the changes in that file, ready for committing. To allow for this,\n",
    "Git has a special **staging area** (also called the **index**) where it keeps\n",
    "track of things that should go into the next commit. It might help to remember\n",
    "these terms by thinking of `git add` as 'setting the stage' for the next commit. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Best practice: commit little and often\n",
    "A commit is much easier to digest if it contains few changes. In fact, you should aim for each commit to capture one conceptual change to your work that can stand alone. This will make the history of your files' development much easier to follow. A good rule of thumb: a commit should capture a change that you can describe in about 50 characters or fewer, potentially with extra explanation in the commit message if needed. Examples (with commit message):\n",
    "* Adding a new function to read in some sequencing data ('_Add a function to read in sequencing data_').\n",
    "* Updating a configuration file to include the setting required for a particular experiment ('_Change settings for experiment A simulation_' — the rest of the commit message may then give more detail on what these settings are).\n",
    "* Giving a variable a better name, which may be done across multiple files in the same commit ('_Rename input variable to a more descriptive name_').\n",
    "* Adding this box about best practice for commit ('_Add content about best practice for commits_').\n",
    "This is something you gain a feel for as you use Git more and study other developers' work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selective staging\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make some more changes to our example repository, in a way that\n",
    "demonstrates the flexibility afforded by separating out the 'add' and 'commit'\n",
    "steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll first modify `Git-cheatsheet` to include a note about how to use\n",
    "`git add` for staging changes to files.\n",
    "Note that, although we've only seen an example of adding changes to a single file, we\n",
    "can actually add changes to multiple files by listing them out when running\n",
    "`git add`, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "git add path/to/file1 path/to/file2 path/to/file3 ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we add the following lines to `Git-cheatsheet.md`:\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "## Adding / committing changes\n",
    "\n",
    "`git add <files>` — Stages changes in the `<files>`, ready for committing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we've also seen some tips on good practice about commits and commit\n",
    "messages. So let's create a new file, called `Commit-good-practice.md` and record\n",
    "what we learnt about commit messages:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# Best practice when committing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Commit messages\n",
    "\n",
    "[Good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\n",

    "required. Generally, the summary should complete the sentence \"If applied, this\n",
    "commit will [_commit message here_]\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid uninformative messages such as \"small tweaks\" or \"updates\" — write what\n",

    "* The repository — a permanent record of changes (commits) that have been\n",

    "`git add` moves changes from the working tree to the staging area, and `git commit`\n",

    "Using the modify-add-commit cycle, add more content to the cheatsheet and commit good practice documents, by adding an entry in the cheatsheet about the `--message` / `-m` option for `git commit` and including a section on 'committing little and often' in the `Commit-good-practice.md` document. Try practising 'selective staging' when you do this: modify both files to begin with, but then commit the changes one file at a time by using `git add` selectively.\n",
