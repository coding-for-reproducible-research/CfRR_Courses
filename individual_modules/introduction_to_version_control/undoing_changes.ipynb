    "### Reverting (undo a commit by making a new one)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's suppose we've 'accidentally' made a new commit which puts `TODO.txt` under\n",

    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",

    "The command\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "git revert <commit>\n",
    "```\n",
    "can be used to create a new commit that undoes a previous `<commit>`. In our\n",
    "case, we want to undo the commit where we added `TODO.txt`, i.e. commit\n",
    "`cc01bda`. We'll run that shortly, but first we need to make sure to make\n",
    "a temporary copy of `TODO.txt` and store it outside the repository. This is\n",
    "because the revert will return the repository to the state before we'd added\n",
    "`TODO.txt`, which will involve deleting the file. Having done this, we now\n",
    "perform the reversion:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git revert cc01bda\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `git revert` is actually making a new commit, our text editor pops into\n",
    "life for us to write a commit message. It's been pre-populated with a\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resetting (move back to a previous commit and lose later ones)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reverting a commit is often considered a 'safe' way to undo a commit, because\n",
    "the original, offending commit is not actually lost. This way, if we decide we\n",
    "_did_ in fact want to make that commit, we can easily recover it (by doing\n",
    "`git revert` on it). There is a\n",
    "more destructive way to undo commit history that will get rid of the commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `git reset` command is used to move back our `HEAD` to an earlier commit.\n",
    "The default form of the command is:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "git reset <commit>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In effect, this will 'rewind' the commit history back to finish at the given\n",
    "`<commit>`, dropping later commits as if they'd never happened. However, it will\n",
    "put all changes since `<commit>` in the working tree, giving us a chance to\n",
    "work with the files as they currently are before the reset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's create an empty file `foo.txt`. We can do this using\n",
    "the `touch` command within the root folder of our repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ touch foo.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll make a commit of this new file and remove it via a reset. First, we make\n",
    "the commit:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git add foo.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "$ git commit -m \"Add foo.txt to practice resetting\"\n",
    "[main fcecec0] Add foo.txt to practice resetting\n",
    " 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n",

    "\n",
    "$ ls\n",
    "foo.txt  Git-cheatsheet.md  Good-practice-guides/  README.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now reset the commit history back to how it was before\n",
    "we committed `TODO.txt`. We check the log to get the commit identifier,\n",
    "perform our reset, then check the status of the repository:\n",

    "\n",
    "We can see that our new `HEAD`, i.e. our new 'current commit', is what we reset\n",
    "to, namely `0984d2b`. What state will our working tree be in? The answer is that it\n",
    "will contain the changes that would need to be made to recover the state of\n",
    "the repository as it was at `HEAD` just before the reset (at the\n",
    "now-removed commit `fcecec0`). In other words, we expect to see just the change\n",
    "that adds `foo.txt`. We can verify this with `git status`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.\n",
    "  (use \"git push\" to publish your local commits)\n",
    "\n",
    "Untracked files:\n",
    "  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n",
    "        foo.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't want to keep this `foo.txt` file, so let's just delete it with the\n",
    "usual Unix command `rm` to get a nice, clean working tree again.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ rm foo.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After all that, we can move that TODO list back into the repository. We'll\n",
    "finish by removing the tasks we've completed and add some new tasks, leaving our\n",
    "list like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "TODO:\n",
    "\n",
    "Add cheatsheet entries for `git rm` and `git mv`\n",
    "\n",
    "Add cheatsheet entries for pushing and pulling\n",
    "\n",
    "Add cheatsheet entries about undoing changes\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hard reset\n",
    "If you're really sure you don't need to keep the changes from later commits when resetting, then you can automatically discard them by using the `--hard` option: `git reset --hard <commit>`. This will set your working tree to the exact same state as the commit you're resetting to. It thus deletes the work you did after `<commit>`; be sure that this is what you want before running a hard reset!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Warning: pushing after a reset\n",
    "\n",
    "Something to be aware of when using `git reset` is that you can't by default push to a\n",
    "remote repository if the tip of your local `main` branch is pointing to a commit\n",
    "that is behind where the remote repository (`origin/main`) is.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we had reset our local repository to the commit _before_\n",
    "`origin/main`, i.e. commit `5cf8321`, \"Remove rubbish.txt\". If we then tried to push\n",
    "our local repository to the remote one, Git would not complete the request and\n",
    "complain to us with the following message:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git push origin\n",
    "To https://github.com/jbloggs9999/git-good-practice.git\n",
    " ! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)\n",
    "error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/jbloggs9999/git-good-practice.git'\n",
    "hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind\n",
    "hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.\n",
    "hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.\n",
    "hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason for this is to avoid a situation where commit history in the\n",
    "remote repository gets lost. This is especially important when collaborating\n",
    "with others, which we'll cover in later episodes in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more on the topic of resetting on\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important note: sensitive data\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods for undoing commits discussed here are appropriate when the commit\n",
    "you made in error contains changes you didn't want, but don't fundamentally matter\n",
    "if they've been recorded in the repository. In fact, even with a reset, it is\n",
    "possible to recover the commit, with some advanced Git use that involves\n",
    "something called the\n",
    "<a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noreferrer\">reflog</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that, if you accidentally commit _sensitive data_, such as passwords\n",
    "or confidential information, you cannot work on the basis that `git reset` or\n",
    "`git revert` has removed the data from the repository. Moreover, if you\n",
    "pushed the commits to a remote repository, the information will be stored there.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases, you need to use specialist tools to remove all traces of the\n",
    "sensitive data from the repository. See\n",
    "<a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noreferrer\">the GitHub documentation</a> for information on this topic.\n",
