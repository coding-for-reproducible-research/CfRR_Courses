    "# Ignoring Files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "- Create a `.gitignore` file to specify files and directories that Git should ignore\n",
    "- Understand how to use comments within a `.gitignore` file\n",
    "- Use pathspecs to ignore groups of similar files\n",
    "- IDentify the types of files that should be typically be ignored in a Git repository\n",
    "- Force Git to add ignored files if necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ignoring files\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently we still have our `TODO.txt` file hanging around in the working tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.\n",
    "  (use \"git push\" to publish your local commits)\n",
    "\n",
    "Untracked files:\n",
    "  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n",
    "        TODO.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While this file is recognised by Git, there's always a risk we might accidentally\n",
    "commit it to the repository. Git provides a way to **ignore** files, so that\n",
    "any changes to these files are just ignored by Git. We can do this by creating\n",
    "a special file, which must be named `.gitignore`, in the root folder of the\n",
    "repository. In this file we specify which files Git should ignore; when doing\n",
    "this, we need to specify paths relative to the root directory of the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore create a `.gitignore` file in the root folder of `git-good-practice`\n",
    "and add the following content to it to ensure the `TODO.txt` file is ignored:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "TODO.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `.gitignore` comments\n",
    "Any line that begins with a hash (`#`) in a `.gitignore` file is treated as a comment and thus not processed by Git. Note that the line must have `#` as the first character to be considered a comment e.g. a comment line cannot begin with whitespace followed by `#`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we check the state of the working tree again:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.\n",
    "  (use \"git push\" to publish your local commits)\n",
    "\n",
    "Untracked files:\n",
    "  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n",
    "        .gitignore\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing Git notices now is the newly-created `.gitignore` file.\n",
    "In general, it's useful to keep the `.gitignore` file under version control, so\n",
    "that other users of the repository can also have the same things ignored as we\n",
    "do. Let's add and commit `.gitignore`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git add .gitignore\n",
    "\n",
    "$ git commit -m \"Ignore TODO list file\"\n",
    "[main 42a9a32] Ignore TODO list file\n",
    " 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n",
    " create mode 100644 .gitignore\n",
    "\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 2 commits.\n",
    "  (use \"git push\" to publish your local commits)\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing to commit, working tree clean\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As a bonus, using `.gitignore` helps us avoid accidentally adding files\n",
    "to the repository that we don't want to track:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git add TODO.txt\n",
    "The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:\n",
    "TODO.txt\n",
    "hint: Use -f if you really want to add them.\n",
    "hint: Turn this message off by running\n",
    "hint: \"git config advice.addIgnoredFile false\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As the message says, if we really want to override our ignore settings,\n",
    "we can use `git add -f` to force Git to add something. We can also always see\n",
    "the status of ignored files if we want:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git status --ignored\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 2 commits.\n",
    "  (use \"git push\" to publish your local commits)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignored files:\n",
    "  (use \"git add -f <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n",
    "        TODO.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing to commit, working tree clean\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ignore similar files with pathspecs\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have been specifying files individually whenever we want to ignore them.\n",
    "Git has its own mini-language for referring to multiple, related files\n",
    "simultaneously, which can give us much more flexibility in certain situations,\n",
    "such as when specifying files to ignore.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done through what are called **pathspecs**. We already touched on these\n",
    "when we discussed e.g. using `git add` on all files in a directory. We aren't\n",
    "going to cover everything there is to know about pathspecs, but here are some\n",
    "examples that cover quite a lot of cases in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `.` refers to files in the current working directory and all directories\n",
    "  descended from it (e.g. would include `./foo/bar/baz/file.txt`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Specifying a directory `foo` will limit to files that descend from `foo`\n",
    "  (e.g. `./foo/bar/baz/file.txt` but not `./qux/bar/file.txt`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* `*.pyc` refers to all `.pyc` files in the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `foo/bar/*.pyc` matches all `.pyc` files in the directory `foo/bar`\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commands in Git that work on files also work on pathspecs and you'll see\n",
    "this term in the help pages (try `git add --help` for an example).\n",
    "For the complete specification of pathspecs, check out the\n",
    "Git Glossary manual, by running `man gitglossary` and paging down to the entry\n",
    "for `pathspec`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a few dummy files for trying this out, imagining that we've got\n",
    "some research code that takes in data files, outputs some results and produces\n",
    "a log file of the run. We use the Unix commands `mkdir`\n",
    "to create a new `data` directory and `touch` to create new files:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ mkdir data\n",
    "\n",
    "$ touch data/a.dat data/b.dat data/c.dat\n",
    "\n",
    "$ touch a.out b.out c.out\n",
    "\n",
    "$ touch 2023-02-10-15-36-02_modelRun.log\n",
    "\n",
    "$ ls\n",
    "2023-02-10-15-36-02_modelRun.log  a.out  b.out  c.out  data/  Git-cheatsheet.md  Good-practice-guides/  README.md  TODO.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "$ ls data/\n",
    "a.dat  b.dat  c.dat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As expected, Git detects all of these as untracked files:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 2 commits.\n",
    "  (use \"git push\" to publish your local commits)\n",
    "\n",
    "Untracked files:\n",
    "  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n",

    "        data/\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can succinctly tell Git to ignore these files by adding three different\n",
    "pathspecs:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "TODO.txt\n",

    "# Ignore files in the data folder and subfolder therein\n",

    "*.log\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ignore .out files in the root folder of the repository\n",
    "*.out\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can see that all these files have become ignored by Git:\n",

    "no changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this was just for experimenting with pathspecs, we'll clean up by setting\n",
    "our `.gitignore` file back to just containing `TODO.txt` and removing the\n",
    "files and `data` directory we created.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",

    "## What kind of files should be ignored?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've suggested, not all files should be kept under version control in a\n",
    "Git repository. For one thing, certain files only serve to bloat the repository,\n",
    "potentially affecting the performance of Git (e.g. when syncing with a\n",
    "remote repository). For another, some files may contain sensitive information\n",
    "that should not be shared with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of files that should definitely not be kept under version\n",
    "control:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sensitive files that should not be shared with others, e.g. passwords, access\n",
    "  tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Artifacts from the process of building software e.g. compiled Python files\n",
    "  (`.pyc`) or similar, compiled executables, `.o` files, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Anything that is tied to you, your computer, or the operating system you use,\n",
    "  which may not work or mean anything to other users of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of files that should generally not be kept under version\n",
    "control, though there may be legitimate exceptions in some cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data files, especially if these are quite large.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Binary files, such as images, audio, certain kinds of data formats, PDFs and\n",
    "  the like. Git is designed to work with text-based files e.g. source code\n",
    "  files. Although Git can store binary files in repositories, it will not be able\n",
    "  to display changes to these files, limiting the benefits gained from Git in\n",
    "  this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any files that are output from the software in the repository (including log\n",
    "  files). If anything can be generated from the software then there's no need\n",
    "  to store it under version control, since it can be regenerated if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3rd party package dependencies. Instead, a suitable\n",
    "  specification file (e.g. a `requirements.txt` file for\n",
    "  Python pip packages, a Conda environment specification file, etc.) should be\n",
    "  kept under version\n",
    "  control to allow users to obtain software dependencies themselves.\n",
