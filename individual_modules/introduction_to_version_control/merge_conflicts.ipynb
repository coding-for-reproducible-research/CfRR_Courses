    "Let's suppose we have two branches, `branch-a` and `branch-b`, with `branch-b`\n",
    "branching off of `branch-a` at commit `C`. As\n",
    "commits get added to these two branches after `C`, it's possible that a particular file\n",
    "will be modified on both branches in ways that are incompatible. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The same line in a file might get edited on both `branch-a` and `branch-b`\n",
    "  in different ways.\n",
    "\n",

    "  \n",
    "In cases such as these, when we try to merge `branch-b` back into `branch-a`,\n",
    "Git has no way of determining which edits are the 'correct' version to take forward: from\n",
    "its point of view, it has no reason to say why one set of edits should be\n",
    "preferred over the other. In this case, Git will say that the file contains a\n",
    "**merge conflict** (or just a **conflict**), and it will require us\n",
    "to further specify how the conflict should be **resolved**.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* It's also giving us a clue (albeit somewhat vaguely) about how to complete\n",

    "  1. Modify the file to fix the conflicts i.e. write in what we want the file\n",
    "     to contain going forward.\n",
    "  2. Stage the fixed file with `git add` (this will 'mark the file as resolved')\n",

    "The content between the markers `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` contains the changes that were made on the current branch i.e. the changes as they are at `HEAD`. In contrast, the content between the markers `=======` and `>>>>>>> main` represents the changes that have been made on the incoming branch, which in example above is `main`. (Of course, in the general case the incoming branch could be a different branch, in which case the name of this branch will be used in the third marker.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to fix this conflict, we simply need to edit this text so that it contains\n",

    "we need to make a choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do we stick with the version we added to our feature branch (i.e. the `HEAD`\n",
    "  version), where `git push` comes before `git pull`?\n",

    "* Do we go for the version that appears on the `main` branch, which has\n",
    "  the two commands the other way around?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Or do we keep some combination of the two sets of changes?\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we only want to keep one set of changes, although it's simply\n",
    "a matter of taste which we go for. Let's go for the second option, i.e. the\n",
    "version as it is on `main`. All we therefore need to do is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Delete all the content corresponding to the `HEAD` change, i.e. delete the\n",
    "  content between the `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Delete the lines corresponding to the merge conflict markers: `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======` and\n",
    "  `>>>>>>> main`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having done that, and having saved our changes to `Git-cheatsheet.md`, the\n",
    "content of `Git-cheatsheet` looks like this:\n",

    "(`All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.`) It also tells us that our\n",

    "## General advice on merge conflicts and collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no silver bullet, or special branching strategy, for avoiding merge\n",
    "conflicts. _The only way to avoid conflicts is to communicate with each other._\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to avoid the situation where two people work on the same part of a file\n",
    "in different branches, since this will cause a conflict when merging\n",
    "the branches back into `main`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to avoid conflicts is to ensure different branches work on\n",
    "different files as much as possible. Admittedly, this is not always possible or \n",
    "practical. If you need to work on a file which may also be in the process of being\n",
    "edited in another branch, then you should flag this with collaborators\n",
    "and agree a way forward which integrates both sets of changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's also good practice to make sure everyone is aware when a feature branch\n",
    "has been merged into `main` on the remote repository. This ensures everyone can\n",
    "update their local repositories and make sure their work builds on top of the\n",
    "latest version of the common codebase. GitHub can be set up so that collaborators\n",
    "on a repository are notified when a new pull request is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you get a conflict when trying to merge `main` into a feature branch\n",
    "and the incoming changes affect the correctness of what you're doing, then\n",
    "have a call with the person whose work has caused the conflict, to discuss the\n",
    "problem and agree how you will resolve the conflict to move forward.\n",
