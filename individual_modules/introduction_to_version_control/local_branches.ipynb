    "## Repository files\n",
    "\n",
    "We've had quite a lot of episodes working on our `git-good-practice` repository.\n",
    "We've included here copies of the files that we will build on from this episode\n",
    "onwards. If you haven't been following along with all the examples or exercises,\n",
    "we suggest updating the files in your repository with the contents of one of\n",
    "the following archives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a Zip archive: [git-good-practice.zip](downloads/git-good-practice.zip)\n",

    "(note: make sure to preserve the directory structure: the file\n",
    "`Commit-good-practice.md` should be placed in the subdirectory\n",

    "## Concept of branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Git branches are a core feature of the Git version control system. They allow you to create multiple lines of \n",
    "development within a single repository, allowing you to work on multiple features or fixes simultaneously, without \n",
    "affecting the main codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, a branch is a separate series of commits of the codebase that diverges from the main codebase. You can think of \n",
    "it as a separate timeline of changes that runs in parallel with the main timeline. Each branch contains a copy of the \n",
    "entire codebase, with its own set of changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A Git branch](images/branch.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Git branches are incredibly useful for collaborative development, as they allow multiple developers to work on \n",
    "different features or fixes simultaneously, without stepping on each other's toes. They also provide a way to \n",
    "experiment with new features or ideas without affecting the stability of the main codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with local branches\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to add some new content to the cheatsheet, doing this in a new, dedicated\n",
    "branch. The content we'll add will be about using branches, so we'll be recording\n",
    "what we learn as we go. The material on branches in this episode concerns working\n",
    "with _local_ branches: branches that are created in our local repository, rather\n",
    "than remotely on GitHub. The next episode will look at remote branches in more\n",
    "detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating branches\n",
    "\n",
    "The general way to create a new branch in our local repository is:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "git branch <new-branch-name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `<new-branch-name>` is the name of the branch we wish to work on.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a new branch, you can specify the starting point. By default, if you do not specify a \n",
    "starting point, Git will create the new branch at the `HEAD` commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `HEAD` is a reference to the current commit in the branch you are currently working on. It is essentially a pointer \n",
    "to the tip of the branch you have checked out, which can be moved to any commits in the branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a new branch at the current commit, Git creates a new branch pointer that points to the same commit as \n",
    "the `HEAD`. This means that the new branch initially has the same code as the current branch, but it is a separate branch \n",
    "that can be modified independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be helpful to have a dual picture in your mind when it comes to branches,\n",
    "thinking of them both as a series of commits and also a pointer to a particular\n",
    "commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Branching off a commit\n",
    "You can create a new branch at any commit in the repository's history. This can be useful if you want to create a new  branch based on a specific version of your code, or if you want to experiment with changes from a previous commit  without affecting the current branch. Here's how you can create a new branch at any commit:\n",
    "1. Identify the commit you want to create the branch at: Use the `git log` command to view the commit history of the  repository and find the commit identifier of the commit you want to create the new branch at.\n",
    "2. Create a new branch: Use the `git branch` command with the commit identifier to create a new branch at that commit:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "git branch <new-branch-name> <commit-identifier>\n",
    "```\n",
    "For example, to create a new branch called `experimental-branch` based on a commit with the identifier `abc1234`, you would  run:\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "git branch experimental-branch abc1234\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a new branch called experimental-branch at the specified commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we create a new branch\n",
    "off of our most recent commit, called `branches-material`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git branch branches-material\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will shortly be the branch in which we add new content to the cheatsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Viewing branches\n",
    "\n",
    "We can view all the local branches we have in our local repository by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "git branch --list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(Equivalently, we could use the short form `-l` for `--list`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our `git-good-practice` repository, this would show us:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git branch --list\n",
    "  branches-material\n",
    "* main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The asterisk (\\*) preceding \"main\" is used to indicate the currently checked out branch in your local repository.\n",
    "Another way to find out which branch you have checked out is to run `git status`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `main` is just a branch\n",
    "The main branch in Git is simply a branch like any other branch in your repository, created automatically  to hold the initial commit of the repository's history.\n",
    "Because the main branch is created automatically and is the default branch, it is often used as the primary branch for a project's development. However, you can choose to rename the main branch or use a different branch as the primary branch if you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding commits to a branch\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to work on a branch, we need to **checkout** the branch so that any\n",
    "new commits we make are added to the branch. The general command for doing this\n",
    "is:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "git checkout <branch>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Branching off a branch\n",
    "There is nothing stopping us from creating a new branch that starts on a different branch to `main`. For example, suppose you have checked out a branch called `feature-branch`, and you want to create a new branch called `bugfix-branch` on top of `feature-branch`. If you do not specify a starting point for the new branch, Git will create it at the current commit on  `feature-branch`, i.e. the commit that `HEAD` is pointing to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We now switch to our new branch `branches-material` so that\n",
    "our new cheatsheet content will feature in this branch, rather than the branch\n",
    "`main`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git checkout branches-material \n",
    "Switched to branch 'branches-material'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We're now ready to get to work in the branch `branches-material`. We add the\n",
    "following content to `Git-cheatsheet.md` on what we just learned about creating\n",
    "a branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "\n",
    "## Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "`git branch <branch>` — Create a new local branch called `<branch>` based at the\n",
    "                        current commit (i.e. at `HEAD`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We make a commit with the new change:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git add Git-cheatsheet.md\n",
    "\n",
    "$ git commit -m \"Add entry about creating branches\"\n",
    "[branches-material 8124186] Add entry about creating branches\n",
    " 1 file changed, 6 insertions(+)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We next add an entry to our cheatsheet about checking out a branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "`git checkout <branch>` — Check out the branch `<branch>`, so that new commits\n",
    "                          are added to `<branch>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Having committed this change, we now view the log to see our new commits:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git log --oneline -5\n",
    "51da8da (HEAD -> branches-material) Add entry about checking out a branch\n",
    "8124186 Add entry about creating branches\n",
    "42a9a32 (origin/main, origin/HEAD, main) Ignore TODO list file\n",
    "0984d2b Add material on basic pathspec usage (directories)\n",
    "92b2ac2 Create general good practice guides directory\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the new commits have been added to the branch `branches-material` \n",
    "and that we are now working on `branches-material` as indicated by \n",
    "`HEAD -> branches-material`. We can also see that commits to `main` stop at \n",
    "commit `42a9a32` shown by `origin/main, origin/HEAD, main`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can verify that these new commits are not on the `main` branch by examining\n",
    "the log of `main` directly. In general, we can run\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "git log [options] <branch>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to view the commit history contained in a specific branch `<branch>`, where\n",
    "`[options]` are any optional arguments we want to include e.g `--oneline`. In\n",
    "our example, we get the following history for the `main` branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git log --oneline -5 main\n",
    "42a9a32 (origin/main, origin/HEAD, main) Ignore TODO list file\n",
    "0984d2b Add material on basic pathspec usage (directories)\n",
    "92b2ac2 Create general good practice guides directory\n",
    "5cf8321 Remove rubbish.txt\n",
    "d26a698 Add some rubbish to try out 'git rm'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms that the new commits are not on the `main` branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Merging branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now look at how we can incorporate the changes we've made in the\n",
    "`branches-material` branch into our `main` branch. In Git parlance, we want\n",
    "to **merge** the commit history in `branches-material` into the history of\n",
    "the `main` branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merging is a way to bring together different streams of development and integrate \n",
    "them into a cohesive whole. This is the key to using Git for collaboration, as\n",
    "it allows multiple developers to work on different \n",
    "aspects of a project simultaneously _and then collate their changes_.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this with the `merge` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "git merge <branch-to-bring-in>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `<branch-to-merge-in>` is the name of the branch whose commits we want\n",
    "to bring _into_ the branch we're currently on.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Merging branches](images/merge.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we need to merge the branch `branches-material` into `main`.\n",
    "To do this, we need to checkout the branch we want to merge _into_, i.e.\n",
    "`main`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git checkout main\n",
    "Switched to branch 'main'\n",
