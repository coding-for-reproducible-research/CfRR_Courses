    "# Collaborating with Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "- Understand and implement feature branching for collaborative work\n",
    "- Create and manage feature branches on GitHub\n",
    "- Merge feature branches into the main branch following a specific protocol\n",
    "- Resolve conflicts and ensure smooth integration of changes from multiple collaborators\n",
    "- Utilize best practices for collaboration using Git and GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collaborating with others\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've only been using Git and GitHub as a solo developer. But the real\n",
    "power of version control systems is realised when collaborating with other\n",
    "developers on a shared project. Branching in Git provides the means for multiple\n",
    "people in a way that allows them to work concurrently and bring their work together\n",
    "in a controlled, transparent way. If you're using GitHub to host your remote\n",
    "repository, then pull requests provide a way to communicate to others about\n",
    "your changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key thing to remember when collaborating with Git is that, while there may\n",
    "only be a single remote repository, _every developer has their own local repository_ that\n",
    "is linked to the remote repository. The corollary to this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* each developer is responsible for pushing the work from their local repository\n",
    "  to the remote one; and\n",
    "\n",
    "* each developer needs to pull in work that others have contributed to the\n",
    "  remote repository into their local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important that this is done promptly and regularly so that any changes\n",
    "are not missed by you or others.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different strategies and philosophies on how branches can be used\n",
    "for collaboration. For this course, we're going to discuss a simple strategy\n",
    "called _feature branching_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature branching\n",
    "\n",
    "A **feature** in this context is any piece of work that adds to the\n",
    "software's overall development, whether this be a new piece of functionality, a\n",
    "bug fix, some documentation, etc. In feature branching, new features are\n",
    "developed in their own, dedicated **feature branches** that branch off the\n",
    "`main` branch. When the feature is ready to be shared with others, the feature\n",
    "branch is merged back into `main`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `main` branch and feature branches take on different roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The `main` branch**: This includes code changes that you want to share with\n",
    "  each other, or that are ready for release into the world. You should consider\n",
    "  it the 'neat' version of your work. As a general rule, _code only makes it into\n",
    "  `main` through merging a feature branch. You don't commit directly to `main`._\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Feature branches**: These are branches where you work on code to develop\n",
    "  features, so will contain 'work in progress' until they're ready to merge\n",
    "  back into `main`. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common scenario you will come across when working on a feature branch is\n",
    "where `main` gets updated through someone else merging a feature branch they're\n",
    "working on. When it comes to you merging your feature branch into `main`, the\n",
    "golden rule is to make sure you merge any changes to `main` _into_ your\n",
    "feature branch _before_ merging your feature branch into `main`. This ensures\n",
    "you are adding your work to the latest version of the 'common' codebase and\n",
    "resolve any issues in your feature branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It gives you a chance to check that the changes you are making are consistent\n",
    "  with other peoples' work. Some changes made by others may pass under the radar\n",
    "  when merging e.g. different naming of functions / variables to what your\n",
    "  code relies on, deletion or moving of code your work relies on, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It also gives you a chance to resolve any _merge conflicts_ that may arise\n",
    "  when you try to merge your work into the common codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of feature branching is depicted below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Feature branching](images/feature-branching.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating feature branches\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be creating feature branches using the workflow described in the previous\n",
    "episode:\n",
    "feature branches will be created remotely on GitHub and then fetched in for us\n",
    "to work on locally. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Protocol for merging feature branches into `main`\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we give steps for merging a feature branch `foo-feature` into `main`. We\n",
    "assume `foo-feature` exists both as a remote branch in the remote repository and\n",
    "also a local tracking branch in our local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a pull request on GitHub corresponding to the merge of `foo-feature`\n",
    "   into `main`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pull any changes to `main` on the remote repository into your local version\n",
    "   of `main` (using `git pull` on your local `main` branch). \n",
    "\n",
    "   a) If `main` was unchanged by the pull then go to step 2,\n",
    "      otherwise go to step b) below.\n",
    "\n",
    "   b) If `main` got updated by the pull, then merge `main` into `foo-feature`\n",
    "      in your local repository before continuing, by using `git merge`.\n",
    "      If there are merge conflicts, these MUST be resolved and the merge into\n",
    "      `foo-feature` completed before continuing to step c) below (see the later\n",
    "      episode on merge conflicts\n",
    "      for details on how to do this). Also take the\n",
    "      opportunity to make sure this merge hasn't introduced any problems into\n",
    "      the codebase (e.g. inconsistencies in naming, etc.)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   c) Pull the remote `main` into your local `main` again to be\n",
    "      sure no further changes were made while you were performing the merge in\n",
    "      step b). If the branch wasn't updated then proceed\n",
    "      to step 3 below, otherwise curse your luck and go back to step b).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Push the commits in your local `foo-feature` branch to the corresponding\n",
    "   remote branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Complete the pull request on GitHub to merge the `foo-feature` branch\n",
    "   into `main` on the remote.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Pull the changes to `main` from the remote repository into your local repository.\n",
    "   Optional, but recommended: delete the feature branch `foo-feature` from GitHub\n",
    "   and from your remote repository (including the reference `origin/foo-feature`\n",
    "   to the remote branch).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Joe Bloggs and Jane Doe\n",
    "\n",
    "We're now going to assume that Joe Bloggs and Jane Doe are two people collaborating\n",
    "on the `git-good-practice` repository. They will work with the same\n",
    "remote repository, created under Joe's account, but will each have their own\n",
    "associated local repositories. They're going to use the _feature branch_\n",
    "strategy, discussed in the previous section, to add:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Material to the cheatsheet about fetching remote branches from a remote\n",
    "  repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A new file documenting good practice when collaborating together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for two people to work on the same remote repository on GitHub, they\n",
    "each need to be listed as collaborators on the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaborators on a GitHub repository\n",
    "If you are the owner of a repository on GitHub, you can invite collaborators to work on the repository using the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noreferrer\">instructions in the GitHub documentation</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point in the course, we encourage participants to pair up and work\n",
    "together on a common repository, taking the roles of Joe and Jane.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, find a partner to work with. Have one of you invite the other as a collaborator\n",
    "on your repository. The collaborator should then clone the other person's\n",
    "repository using the above instructions, so that you are both working on a\n",
    "common remote repository. In what follows, one of you should play the role of\n",
    "Joe Bloggs and the other of Jane Doe.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solo work\n",
    "If you are working through these course notes by yourself then try imagining you are two different developers collaborating on the repository together. We suggest you clone a fresh copy of the remote repository to a new local repository on your computer, while keeping your original local repository. This will help you simulate the scenario of collaborators each having their own local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating the branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Joe and Jane begin by creating remote branches on GitHub for their work, creating\n",
    "these at the same time:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Joe** creates a remote branch called `fetching-material`, which will contain\n",
    "  material about fetching from a remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Jane** creates a remote branch called `collaboration-good-practice`, which\n",
    "  will contain work on good practice while collaborating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, Joe and Jane need to each create a local branch\n",
    "that will track their remote branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Joe's local branch\n",
    "\n",
    "Joe fetches references to the new branches in the remote repository, then\n",
    "creates a new local branch to track his remote `fetching-material` branch (and\n",
    "also checks out this new local branch):\n",
