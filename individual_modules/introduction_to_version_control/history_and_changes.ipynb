    "### Paging the Log\n",
    "When the output of `git log` is too long to fit in your screen, Git uses a program called a _pager_ to split it into pages of the size of your screen. When this pager is called, you will notice that the last line in your screen is a `:`, instead of your usual prompt.\n",
    "*   To get out of the pager, press <kbd>Q</kbd>.\n",
    "*   To move to the next page, press <kbd>Spacebar</kbd>.\n",
    "*   To search for `some_word` in all pages, press <kbd>/</kbd> and type `some_word`. Navigate through matches pressing <kbd>N</kbd>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The log contains one entry for each commit. The commit messages for the\n",
    "commits are included, as well as details of who made the commit. The name and email address\n",
    "are those that were given when configuring Git (see the episode Setting up Git and GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, each commit has a unique **identifier** associated to it, which is the long\n",
    "random-looking string next to each commit. (The identifiers for your\n",
    "commits may differ from those above.) We can refer to commits by their\n",
    "identifiers within Git. As we'll shortly see, commits can also be identified via\n",
    "their **short identifier**, which is just the first 7 characters of the usual\n",
    "identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git also has a way of referring to the current, or most recent, commit: this is\n",
    "called `HEAD`. In the above output, `HEAD` refers to the commit with message\n",
    "\"Add advice on committing little and often\" (as indicated by `(HEAD -> main)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limiting log output\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid having `git log` cover your entire terminal screen, you can limit the\n",
    "number of commits that Git lists by using `-n`, where `n` is the number of\n",
    "commits that you want to view. For example, if you only want information from\n",
    "the last commit you can use `git log -1`:\n",

    "## `git diff`: viewing changes\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key features of Git is being able to see the changes that\n",
    "have been made to files when working in a Git repository, not just a record of\n",
    "the commits. The `git diff` command gives us access to this information.\n",
    "Like many Git commands, `git diff` can take arguments in several different\n",
    "formats, depending on things like the optional arguments used. We'll focus on\n",
    "two basic use cases of `git diff`, considering various shortcut forms along the\n",
    "way:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `git diff <commit1> <commit2> <files>` for viewing differences in files between\n",
    "  particular commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `git diff <files>` and `git diff --staged <files>` for viewing changes to\n",
    "  files that have yet to be staged or, in the second form, yet to be committed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Differences between commits\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first look at how to examine file changes\n",
    "that have been made to go from one commit to another. The general form of\n",
    "the command to do this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "git diff <commit1> <commit2> <files>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Commits should be referred to by their identifiers (either their normal or short\n",

    "`<commit2>`. The `<files>` argument can be a single file or list of multiple\n",

    "The output of `git diff`, as shown above, is cryptic because it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and `patch` telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other. If we break it down into pieces:\n",
    "1. The 'diff' for each file begins with a line like `diff --git a/<filename> b/<filename>`. It tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix `diff` command, comparing the old and new versions of thefile `<filename>`. In the example above, the output starts with the diff for `Commit-good-practice.md` until just before the line  `diff --git a/Git-cheatsheet.md b/Git-cheatsheet.md`, at which point it switches to the diff for `Git-cheatsheet.md`.\n",
    "2. The next few lines in each file's diff tell exactly which versions of the file Git is comparing. Confusingly, it looks like it contains commit identifiers, but these are in face different, computer-generated labels for the versions of the files.\n",
    "3. The remaining lines, beginning `@@`, are the most interesting: they show us the actual differences and the lines on which they occur. In particular, the `+` marker in the first column shows where we added a line. If we had lines that were removed, these would be marked with `-`.\n",
    "\n",
