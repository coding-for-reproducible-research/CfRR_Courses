    "# Remote Branches with GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "- Create remote branches using GitHub\n",
    "- Track remote branches locally\n",
    "- Merge remote branches using a pull request\n",
    "- Delete branches in your local and remote repositories \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local and remote branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches can reside in our local repository and/or remote repository, in the\n",
    "same way that commits can. An **upstream** branch is one which resides in the\n",
    "remote repository and is tracked locally, meaning the local branch is linked to\n",
    "the remote branch. Our local repository stores references to any remote branches,\n",
    "prepending their names with `remotes/origin/` (or simply `origin/`). It should\n",
    "be noted that these remote branches are not updated automatically - we need to\n",
    "use `git fetch` to update them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Viewing branches\n",
    "\n",
    "We can list _all_ the branches that our local repository is aware of (both\n",
    "local branches and remote branches) by using `git branch --all` (or\n",
    "just `git branch -a`):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git branch -a\n",
    "  branches-material\n",
    "* main\n",
    "  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main\n",
    "  remotes/origin/main\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three branches worth noting here, namely `main` (our local version of\n",
    "`main`), `remotes/origin/main` (our remote version of `main`) and `branches-material`\n",
    "(our newly created local branch). We can safely ignore\n",
    "`remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main` for the time being.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have only created `branches-material` locally, it does not have a remote\n",
    "counterpart, unlike `main`. Using GitHub, we can verify there is no remote branch\n",
    "called `branches-material`. The necessary steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1** Navigate to your repository on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 2** Click on _branch(es)_, above the list of files on the left-hand side,\n",
    "  as indicated in the following screenshot:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![Viewing branches on GitHub](images/github-view-branches.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 3** Click on _All branches_, located to the left of the green _New branch_\n",
    "  button on the right-hand side of the screen — this will display a list of all\n",
    "  the branches in your remote repository. `branches-material` will be missing\n",
    "  from this list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with remote branches\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've seen how to create a local branch, commit to it and merge it into\n",
    "another branch (e.g. into `main`). This branch didn't have an upstream branch\n",
    "in the remote repository. We're now going to look at the case where we\n",
    "use GitHub to create a branch in the _remote repository_, which we then\n",
    "bring into our local repository to work with. This approach takes advantage of\n",
    "useful functionality provided by GitHub, promoting collaborative working. We\n",
    "will look at an alternative workflow that doesn't rely on the features GitHub\n",
    "provides in a later episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's add some material to the cheatsheet relating to working with remote\n",
    "branches, using GitHub to drive this development. The basic flow for doing this\n",
    "will be the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a remote branch on GitHub that will receive our additions to the\n",
    "  cheatsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Work on the cheatsheet locally, then push the changes up to the remote branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use GitHub to merge the work into the `main` branch in the remote repository,\n",
    "  using a pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, we need to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a remote branch on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Update our local repository from the remote repository, so that we have a\n",
    "  reference to the newly created remote branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a local branch that is set up to track the remote one.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add new commits to the local branch corresponding to our work on the\n",
    "  cheatsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Push these commits to the upstream remote branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Merge the remote branch into the remote `main` branch, using\n",
    "  a pull request on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Update our local repository to reflect this change to the remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a remote branch on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "In GitHub, the following steps allow you to create a new remote branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1** Navigate to your repository on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 2** Click on the dropdown, located to the left of _branches_, on the\n",
    "  left-hand side of the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 3** Select the branch you would like to create a branch from. (For this\n",
    "  course, this will typically be `main`. If it is `main`, this step\n",
    "  becomes redundant.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 4** Click on the dropdown again and type in the name of your new branch\n",
    "  where it says _Find or create a branch..._.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 5** Click on _Create branch: new-branch from 'base-branch'_, where\n",
    "  _new-branch_ is the name of your new branch and _base-branch_ is the name of\n",
    "  the branch you are branching off of (e.g. `main`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example `git-good-practice` repository, let's suppose we've just created a\n",
    "new remote branch called `remote-branches-material`, which is based on top of\n",
    "`main`. Our local repository doesn't have any knowledge of this new branch, as\n",
    "can be seen by listing the branches:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git branch -a\n",
    "  branches-material\n",
    "* main\n",
    "  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main\n",
    "  remotes/origin/main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fetch the remote branch\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to update our local repository so that it has knowledge of the new\n",
    "remote branch, we use the following command from within our local repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "git fetch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(Like with `git push` and `git pull`, we can instead run `git fetch origin` to\n",
    "be explicit about the reference to the remote repository.)\n",
    "We won't go into too much detail about exactly what `git fetch origin` is doing. For\n",
    "our purposes, we use it to inspect the remote repository for information about\n",
    "any new branches, or commits that have been made in remote branches, that our\n",
    "local repository doesn't yet know about.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, after running `git fetch` in our `git-good-practice`\n",
    "repository, we see that information about the new remote `remote-branches-material`\n",
    "has been retrieved:\n",

    "remote branch. So it automatically creates a new local branch — called `remote-branches-material` — that\n",

    "### Deleting branches from a local repository\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* You can't delete a branch you currently have checked out. So make sure you\n",
    "  checkout a different branch before deletion e.g. do deletions from `main`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deleting branches removes the commits contained in those branches which don't\n",
    "  feature in other branches. So, before deleting a branch, be sure that the\n",
    "  changes you want to keep have been merged into another branch e.g. `main`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We delete our local branches:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ git branch -d branches-material remote-branches-material \n",
    "Deleted branch branches-material (was 3b918f2).\n",
    "Deleted branch remote-branches-material (was 5125372).\n",

    "Deleted remote-tracking branch origin/remote-branches-material (was 5125372).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Force deletion\n",
    "Git may stop you from deleting a branch, because it can't verify that all the commits in the branch have been merged into a corresponding remote branch or another local branch. This is a protection mechanism to stop you from potentially losing changes. If you encounter this but are sure you want to proceed with the deletion, you can force the deletion by using `-D` instead of `-d` in the commands above.\n",
    "\n",
