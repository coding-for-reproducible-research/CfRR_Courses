    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives \n",
    "- Learn how regression analysis can be extended beyond simple linear regression to handle multiple predictor variables and different types of relationships.\n",
    "- Understand the concept and applications of multiple linear regression, including how to include multiple predictor variables in a regression model.\n",
    "- Gain proficiency in using the `lm()` function in R to fit multiple linear regression models and interpret the output.\n",
    "- Learn how to assess the effect and significance of multiple predictor variables simultaneously on an outcome variable.\n",
    "- Identify and understand the assumptions that must be met for multiple linear regression, including the linear relationship, normal distribution of errors, independence of samples, equal variances, and non-collinearity of predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expanding the regression framework\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have considered a single type of regression analysis with one continuous predictor variable and one continuous outcome variable and fitting a straight line between these. This has enabled us to get to grips with the core concepts but regression can do so much more than this. It is an incredibly flexible framework that can handle\n",
    "\n",
    "* different types of variables \n",
    "* multiple variables\n",
    "* different relationships between variables \n",
    "\n",
    "We will now look at how we extend the methodology to allow more complex analysis designs. You should think of regression as a modular approach in which you select the necessary components depending on \n",
    "\n",
    "* the properties of the outcome variable(s)\n",
    "* the properties of the predictor variable(s)\n",
    "* the relationship that you want to model between each predictor variable and outcome variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different types of regression analysis you may be familar with include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple Linear Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1 continuous outcome variable\n",
    "* 1 predictor variable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple Linear Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1 continuous outcome variable\n",
    "* $> 1$ predictor variable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multivariate Linear Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "* multiple correlated dependent variables\n",
    "* $> 0$ predictor variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we are going to discuss *Multiple Linear Regression* which allows us to look at the effect of multiple predictor variables simultaneously on an outcome variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple Linear Regression \n",
    "\n",
    "To include multiple predictor variables in our existing regression framework, we simply need to add these additional terms to our model/equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have two variables $X_1$ and $X_2$, and we want to use these together to predict Y, we can fit the model \n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 X_1 + \\theta_2 X_2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To accommodate the extra predictor variable, we need to include an extra regression coefficient. This is still considered a linear regression model because we are combining the effects of these predictor variables in a linear (additive) manner.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In R, we don't need any new functions to fit a multiple regression model, we can fit these models with the same `lm()` function. As before, R will automatically add the right number of regression coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example where we model the effect of both age and height on weight."

    "## Assessing the Effect of Multiple Predictor Variables Simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons why you might want to model multiple predictor variables simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You are interested in understanding the effects of multiple different factors.\n",
    "2. You think there are some variables that might bias or confound your analysis and you want to adjust for this. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second scenario, some predictor variables are just included so that their effect is captured, but you are not explicitly interested in their results. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first scenario, you might be interested in quantifying the effect of each predictor term individually. This can be achieved by looking at the regression coefficients for each term in turn, as we did for the example above. Alternatively you might be interested in the combined effect of multiple terms in predicting an outcome. We can do this from our regression analysis by reframing the null and alternative hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define our regression model for two predictor variables $X_1$ and $X_2$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 X_1 + \\theta_2 X_2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we were interested if a single regression coefficient was non-zero as if that was the case that regression parameter would cause some quantity to be added to our prediction. The null hypothesis for testing the joint effect of two predictors is based on the same underlying concept, that there is no effect on the outcome from the predictor variables. The mathematical definition of this needs to be changed though to reflect that we have multiple predictor variables and regression coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no effect of $X_1$ and $X_2$ on Y, then the regression coefficients for both terms will be zero. Such that they both get cancelled out of the equation and it can be cimplified to just the intercept. For there to be an improvement in the predictive capability of the model, at least one of the two predictive variables needs to have a non-zero coefficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us the null hypothesis of\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_{null}: \\theta_1 = \\theta_2 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the alternative hypothesis of \n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_{alternative}: \\theta_1 \\neq 0\\text{ or  }\\theta_2 \\neq 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of thinking about this analysis is that we are comparing two models with and without the terms of interest. Our statistical question boils down to which of these models is a better fit to the data?\n",

    "\n",
    "the simpler model 2: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y = \\theta_0 $$\n",

    "To perform this statistical test we need to use the F-distribution rather than the T-distribution. Our test statistic is now based around the idea of variance explained. Mention of either the F-distribution or an analysis of variance explained might trigger an association with ANOVA, analysis of variance. Indeed, you are right, there is a link here. In fact the R function you need to run this analysis is `anova()`. But first we need to define and fit the two models we want to compare. We use just a `1` on the right-hand side of the formula to specify we just want to include an intercept term.\n",

From our analysis of the individual regression coefficients, we know that this is predominantly due to the height variable. \n",

    "\n",
    "So far we have only considered continuous predictor variables such as height and age, or variables not strictly continuous but can fudge to be considered as continuous variables. Next we will look at variables that it is harder to analyse as continuous variables, that is categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider a categorical variable as any scenario where the responses can be grouped into a finite number of categories or classes. In R, this type of variable is called a `factor`. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's consider the simplest type of categorical variable to model, one with only two options or groups. Sometimes this specific instance is called a binary variable. While in your data collection each group might have a text label to describe what the response means for that observation, for mathematical modelling we need to represent this binary variable numerically. This is acheived by recoding the variable such that one group is represented by 0 and one group by 1. With this coding it might be refered to as an indicator or dummy variable, where the 1 is used to specify the presence of some feature (like an exposure) and 0 the absence of that feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the variable sex, we could represent females with 0 and males with 1 and the variable therefore indicates who is male. Note that in R if you include a factor variable in your regression model which has text labels to indicate the `levels`, it will automatically do this numerical recoding for you without you needing to know about it. The default behaviour is for the first category alphabetically to be assigned 0 and the second category to be assigned 1. This is important to remember for interpretation later.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then define our regression model as we did for continuous variables.\n",

In this equation, the variable sex takes either the value 0 or the value 1 for each observation, depending if it is male or female. We also use this coding strategy to make predictions from this equation. Let's demonstrate this - for males and females we can derive an equation that will represent their prediction. \n",

More than that, it is not present in the equation for females but is present in the equation for males, so it specifically captures the difference in males relative to females.

The table below shows how, for each of the three options, across these two indicator variables (\"Asian\" and \"European\"), we can uniquely code for any of the three options. For each participant of these ethnicities, we replace the categorical variable with these values for the two new indicator variables.

Therefore, the `ethnicityAsian` row is estimating the mean difference between Asians and African Americans, while the `ethnicityEuropean` row is estimating the mean difference between the Europeans and African Americans. In this model it is also worth remembering that the intercept gives you the mean value of the outcome (i.e. weight) when the predictor variables are equal to 0. In the table above we can see that when both predictor variables are 0, the observation is an African American. Therefore we can intepret the value of the intercept as the mean of the African Americians (i.e. the reference group).

Determining if the regression coefficient is non-zero means that that term significantly influences the outcome and a relationship between that variable and the outcome can be concluded. In the example above between weight and socioeconomic group, both the p-values for both dummy variables are < 0.05. Therefore we can conclude that there is a significant difference in the mean between the high socioeconomic group and the low socioeconomic groups AND there is a significant difference in the mean weight between the middle and high socioeconomic groups. In this situation it is fairly straightforward to draw a conclusion.   \n",
