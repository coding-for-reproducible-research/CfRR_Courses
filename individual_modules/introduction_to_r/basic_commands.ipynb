    "## Interacting with R\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways of interacting with R: using the console or by using a script. A script is a text file that contains your code. R scripts are often saved with the file extension .r or .R.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want our code and workflow to be reproducible. In other words, we want to write code in a way that anyone (including our future selves) can easily replicate, such that they will obtain the same results from our code on their computer. If we type our commands directly into the Console, they will be forgotten when you close the session.  It is preferable to type the commands you want to run directly into the script editor, so that you can save the script. This way,  you have a complete record of what you did,  you can easily show others how you did it and you can do it again later if needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "RStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor by using the <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd> shortcut. If no text is highlighted, the command on the current line in the script (i.e. where the line containing the cursor) will be sent to the console and executed. Alternatively you can select multiple lines to  send to the console for execution when you press <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd>.\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be times when you want to type directly in the console, for example a quick calculation.  RStudio provides the <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`1`</kbd> and <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`2`</kbd> shortcuts which allow you to jump between the script and the console windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a `>` prompt. If it receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting or sent from the script editor using <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd>), R will try to execute it, and when ready, show the results and come back with a new `>`prompt to indicate it is ready for the next command.\n",
    "\n",
    "If R is still waiting for you to enter more text to complete the current command  the console will show a `+` prompt. It means that you haven't finished entering a complete command. This is because it is expecting a specific character, that finishes a command you have already started. For example, if you open a parenthesis or quotation,  it needs to be closed before the command can be processed. Another way of thinking about this  is R expects for every left-parentheses you include, a right-parentheses to accompany it. Similarly, it expects an even  number of quotation marks. This can be quite frustrating, as it might not be obvious what R is waiting for, but if you're in RStudio and this happens, click inside the console window and press `Esc`; this will cancel the incomplete command and return you to the `>` prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set the Working Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "When using R, often we want to analyse data stored in files on our computer and potentially save some output. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that we are always working in a folder or directory on our computer. There are times when this may not be important (for example running a simulation from given parameters).  But if we want a specific file, we need to tell R where to find it. We do so by specifying the filepath. One common issue when  starting out with programming is understanding where a program (in this case R/Rstudio) is looking for the file(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically, we can find any file from any location given the correct filepath. However, to make our code simpler, it can be helpful  to change location, and move to a folder where the files we want to work on are located. The folder we are currently in is called the working directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a folder on our computer to store all the files we will work on in this training. On your computer, open up a  file explorer window (outside of Rstudio) and create a folder called **R-workshop** somewhere memorable. For example on the Desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Rstudio, we can change the working directory through the drop down menus by selecting options\n",
    "\n",
    "`Session` -> `Set Working Directory` -> `Choose Directory...` \n",
    " \n",
    "We then search for and select the folder we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot of RStudio with the \"Session\" menu open. The cursor is hovering over \"Set Working Directory,\" revealing options: \"To Source File Location,\" \"To Files Pane Location,\" and \"Choose Directory…\" with shortcut Ctrl+Shift+H highlighted.](images/rstudio_workdirectory.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will note that in the R console a line of code has appeared.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot of RStudio showing the Console where the working directory has been set using the setwd() function. The command entered is setwd(\"C:/Users/ejh243/OneDrive - University of Exeter/Desktop/R-workshop\"). Other panes show an empty environment and viewer.](images/rstudio_setwd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the R command that is required to change the current working directory using the function `setwd()`.  The text string inside the \"()\" is the filepath to the folder we want to change to. If you save this to your script,  next time you won't need to click through the menus, you can execute this line of code instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also see that in the File Pane (bottom-right), this has also changed to this new directory. We need to  know where we are such that we can navigate R to find files and locations appropriately.  If we ever get lost we can use `getwd()` to get the path of our current location.\n",

    "# Naming Objects in R \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use any combination of alphanumeric characters, along with dots and underscores, to name an R object. But there are a few ___exceptions___:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Names cannot start with a number;\n",
    "* Names cannot have spaces;\n",
    "* Names cannot be a standalone number such as ```12``` or ```0.34```;\n",
    "* Names cannot be a reserved word such as ```if```, ```else```, ```function```, ```TRUE```, ```FALSE``` and ```NULL``` just to name a few (to see the full list of reserved words, type ```?Reserved```).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of __*valid names*__ include ```a```, ```dat2```, ```cpi_index```, ```.tmp```, and even a standalone dot ```.``` (though a dot can make reading code difficult under certain circumstances).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of __*invalid names*__ include ```1dat```,``` dat 2``` (note the space between ```dat``` and ```2```), ```df-ver2``` (the dash is treated as a mathematical operator), and ```Inf``` (the latter is a reserved word listed in the ```?Reserved``` help document).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can mix cases, but use upper cases with caution since some letters look very much the same in both lower and upper cases (e.g. s and S).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are a core concept in programming, they are commands which tells R to perform a particular task. The utility of a function is that it will perform its given action again and again. R identifies functions by the presence of \"()\" following their name. You can customise how the function behaves by the use of arguments - this is additional information provided to the function to allow it to run. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have already used two functions in this workshop. First we used `setwd()`. We used this function with an argument, which was the path to the folder we  wanted to change to. We can reuse this function to change to an unlimited number of different folders on our computer. Then we used `getwd()`, this is an example  of a function that doesn't require any arguments. "
