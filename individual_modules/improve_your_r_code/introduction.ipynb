    "## Overview\n",
    "Welcome to Improve Your R Code! R is primarily known as a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. However, the flexibility and accessibility of R has led to its popularity across a diverse range of disciplines including biosciences, medicine and, of course, statistics. This workshop aims to extend your existing knowledge of R, enabling you to improve the **style** and the **speed** of your R code. The material for this workshop was created by Conor Crilly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the session you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Be able to write clean, readable, and maintainable R code following the tidyverse style guide.\n",
    "-   Be able to accurately measure the speed of your code using `microbenchmark`.\n",
    "-   Be comfortable with built-in R functions and packages (e.g. `parallel`, `data.table`, `Rcpp`) for improving execution speed.\n",

    "### Introduction to Coding For Reproducible Research\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop is offered as part of the [Coding For Reproducible Research Intiative](https://uniexeterrse.github.io/workshop-homepage/). Our ambition is to offer a recurring annual series of workshops open to all staff and students, with opportunities for novices through to more experienced users, to expand their skillsets and position them to confidently perform the informatics research projects in an efficient and reproducible way. A key objective is that the framework we put in place ensures that the workshops delivered are fit for purpose, of a consistent high standard, that delivery is sustainable in the longer term, minimises the workload burden on those who facilitate them and can adapt and expand as new training needs are identified.\n",

    "-   Research Software Engineering group\n",
    "-   Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (IDSAI)\n",

    "This workshop, and the others in the series, were put together by a series of working groups formed by researchers from across the University supported by Exeter's Research Software Engineering Group. The programme and workshops are under constant evolution. We appreciate your patience as we develop and test these materials and are grateful for your feedback which is a core component of this process. We also need to maintain accurate records of how many participants we have reached, so ask you to mark your attendance on the collaborative document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workshop format\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's workshop is led by Conor Crilly and supported by Michelle Ledbetter and Craig Willis. We are all here because we are passionate about sharing our knowledge and supporting the development of our colleagues. For most of us, this is not a requirement of our current position and we are doing this at the margins of our time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop contains both live demonstrations of R code and exercises for you to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim is to be responsive to the needs of the group. Therefore, think of the schedule as a guide rather than a strict timetable. We welcome questions and queries as we go along, there are helpers in the room so raise your hand if you need assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to highlight that we have a [code of conduct](https://uniexeterrse.github.io/intro-to-r/code.html) and by attending this workshop you are agreeing to abide by it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisite Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will not include an introduction to R, or how to setup and use R or Rstudio. It is assumed you are comfortable coding in R and are familiar with:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Writing and executing commands in the R console.\n",
    "-   Writing functions in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "If not we recommend that you consult our pre-requisite course **Introduction to R**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial contains the course notes, example code snippets plus explanations, exercises for you to try with solutions and quiz questions to test your knowledge Attending a workshop on this topic means there are people on hand to help if you have any questions or issues with the materials. However, these have also been designed such that you should also be able to work through them independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "Please install and load the following R packages:\n",
    "```{R}\n",
    "data.table\n",
    "dplyr\n",
    "learnr\n",
    "microbenchmark\n",
    "parallel\n",
    "parallelly\n",
    "Rcpp\n",
    "styler\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### learnr \n",
    "A interactive learnr tutorial can be downloaded by executing the following commands in R:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "install.packages(\"devtools\") \n",
    "install.packages(\"learnr\") \n",
    "library(devtools)\n",
    "library(learnr)\n",
    "learnr::run_tutorial(\"Improve Your R Code\", \"cfrrRtutorials\", clean = TRUE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can navigate through the sections using the menu on the side. The sections on speed are based on [Measuring Performance](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/perf-measure.html) and [Improving Performance](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/perf-improve.html) by Hadley Wickham.\n"
