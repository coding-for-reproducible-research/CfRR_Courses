    "### Overview\n",
    "R is an interpreted language, meaning it is not compiled into machine code before execution like in C or C++. If you really want to dig into the difference, you could start with [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3265357/compiled-vs-interpreted-languages). If you don't know what this means, don't panic. All we need to know is that loops, especially **nested** loops are typically slow in interpreted languages. That is, they should be avoided if possible in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although vectorising your code is more than just avoiding loops, one aspect of vectorisation **is** avoiding loops. In particular, I mean avoiding loops of R code. One way of avoiding loops in R is through vectorized functions, which have their loops implemented in C under-the-hood. A vectorized function operates on every element of the vector at once, avoiding looping through the vector, in R, and operating element-by-element. By exploiting vectorization we can potentially write **faster** R code, and it is almost certain you have been doing this without even knowing!\n",

By executing `cumsum` **without brackets** in your session you can see that the `cumsum()` function is calling `.Primitive`; this means that R is calling a function which is implemented entirely in C, so it is going to be **fast**."
