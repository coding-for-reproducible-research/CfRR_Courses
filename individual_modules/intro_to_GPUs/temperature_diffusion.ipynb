    "# 3D Temperature Diffusion Model: Bringing it all together\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we start with a straightforward, “naive” implementation of a 3D temperature‐diffusion model to demonstrate the core algorithm.  Once you’ve verified that basic version, you’ll write two optimised variants, one using NumPy on the CPU and one using CuPy on the GPU.  You’ll then generate scaling plots for each implementation and profile them to see exactly where time is spent and how performance diverges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this section is to act as an analogous to a real-world research project, where a PI has given you some code that is scientifically accurate but painfully slow and asked us as software specialists to optimise the code and make it run quicker while producing the same output. \n",

    "## Exercise: Approaching The Problem You Want\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on the “naive” pure-Python diffusion above, your task is to explore and extend the code in a way that resonates with you, some routes you could take include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement Optimized Variants**  \n",
    "   - Rewrite the naive nested-loop Python implementation using NumPy vectorized operations to leverage contiguous array arithmetic.  \n",
    "   - Translate your NumPy version to CuPy so that the heavy array work runs on the GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Performance Profiling & Scaling**  \n",
    "   - Use Python’s `time`, `cProfile`, `NVIDIA NSight` or some other tool to measure per-timestep costs for each implementation (naive, NumPy, CuPy).  \n",
    "   - Generate scaling plots to quantify speedup factors and identify bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memory Footprint & Out-of-Core Strategies**  \n",
    "   - Experiment with different depth/latitude/longitude resolutions and observe GPU vs. CPU memory usage.  \n",
    "   - If you exhaust GPU memory, explore chunking or out-of-core techniques (e.g. processing one depth-slice at a time).  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Domain Decomposition & Halo Exchanges**  \n",
    "   - Split the 3D grid into sub-domains (e.g. along latitude/longitude) for parallel processing.  \n",
    "   - Implement halo (ghost) cell exchanges between sub-domains to maintain correctness at boundaries when updating temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multi-GPU Offloading**  \n",
    "   - Use CuPy’s multi-GPU capabilities (for example, `cupy.cuda.Device`) to assign different sub-domains to separate GPUs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Advanced Kernel Optimizations**  \n",
    "   - Investigate writing custom CUDA kernels (via CuPy RawKernels) or use Numba JIT to fuse loops and reduce launch overhead.  \n",
    "   - Profile memory access patterns; consider tiling or pitched memory layouts to improve cache efficiency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Visualization & Validation**  \n",
    "   - Create interactive Plotly or static Matplotlib visuals of both the diffusion results and your profiling data.  \n",
    "   - Verify that all implementations produce numerically consistent outputs (e.g., compare final temperature fields).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to pick one or more of these directions or combine them—to deepen your understanding of high-performance computing with Python, NumPy, and CuPy. Note that not all of the topics above we have tackled in this course, so you may need to do some independent research if you choose some of the advanced topics. Good luck!  \n"
