    "## Course Description \n",
    "\n",
    "Being an effective programmer is not just about writing code, it’s about designing solutions to problems in a way that a computer would understand, i.e. designing and implementing algorithms. However, most introductory courses focus exclusively on the implementing, ignoring the design elements. Over two sessions, this course will introduce you to some fundamental principles that are the basis of writing computer code in any language and should enable you to write, develop and debug your code more effectively. This course is aimed at anyone who is currently programming or thinking about learning to program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Objectives\n",
    "- Understand what an algorithm is and the role it plays in coding.\n",
    "- Learn a number of computational thinking approaches and concepts for developing algorithms.\n",
    "- Know how to differentiate between bugs related to syntax from those related to the underlying algorithm to facilitate more effective troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisite Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no pre-requisite knowledge and the workshop is designed to be appropriate for anyone interested in any programming language.\n",

    "## Sign-up \n",

    "To check for upcoming course dates and to register, please visit the [Workshop Schedule and Sign-up](../cfrr_program_details/courses_overview.ipynb) page."

    "\n",
    "It may be helpful to have access to a terminal or console (either via RStudio, Python, Mac Terminal, Git Bash or command prompt (Windows)) but this is not critical. No prior knowledge or experience with a particular programming language is needed; the workshop has been designed to be agnostic of any specific language. \n",
