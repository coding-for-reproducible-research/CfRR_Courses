    "# Using Markdown for Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "This beginner-level course introduces the basics of Markdown and how to integrate it with Python. Markdown is a markup language commonly used to format text in a simple and readable way, enabling users to create dynamic documents for reports and documentation. On this course, we will explore dynamic documents, understanding how they work and why they are useful. Through hands-on examples, students will learn how to create, save, and share interactive documents that combine text, code, and output.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This course will be taught using Jupyter Lab but participants are welcome to use any platform or tool they prefer besides Jupyter Lab.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Objectives\n",
    "- Understand the benefits of dynamic documents—including how they streamline workflows, enhance reproducibility, and foster collaboration. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Navigate and use JupyterLab for creating interactive documents that integrate code and documentation seamlessly. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply basic Markdown syntax to format text, structure content, and create readable, well-organized documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Embed Python code within Markdown documents to generate dynamic outputs, such as plots, tables, and results. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a dynamic document that integrates Python code and Markdown to combine narrative, code, and output into a single cohesive document. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Export and save dynamic documents in various formats (e.g., HTML, PDF, Markdown) for sharing, publishing, or printing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisite Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prerequisite Course: Complete the [\"Introduction to Python\"](https://coding-for-reproducible-research.github.io/CfRR_Courses/programme_information/intro_to_python.html) course.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Software and Requirements (optional): Install JupyterLab, ensuring Python and pip are set up on your system. Follow the installation instructions on the above-mentioned CfRR website. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Markdown in JupyterLab: No additional installation needed for basic Markdown support in JupyterLab. \n",
