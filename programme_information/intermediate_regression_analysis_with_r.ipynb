    "# Regression Analysis in R: Adapting to Varied Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Description \n",
    "\n",
    "Regression analysis is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between multiple variables. It is a very flexible tool that can handle a range of different data types (continuous, binary or categorical) and address both complex and simple research questions. In this hands-on workshop you will build on your understanding of simple linear regression and learn how to fit a broader range of regression models with R including logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is delivered as a stand-alone session, it is designed as a part of a series of Regression with R workshops where the content develops the ideas further to give you a comprehensive understanding of how regression can be used to address a broad range of questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The complete series includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction to Regression with R\n",
    "2. Regression Analysis in R: Adapting to Varied Data Types\n",
    "3. Mixed Effects Regression with R\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Objectives\n",
    "- Understand what a generalised linear model is\n",
    "- Fit logistic regression models with R \n",
    "- Select the appropriate regression model for either a continuous or binary outcome\n",
    "- Include a range of different types of predictor variables in regression models\n",
    "- Interpret the coefficients of a regression model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisite Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "Learners are expected to already be familiar with the basics of R, such as how to load a dataset from a local file and manipulate variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also assume that you are comfortable with fitting simple linear regression models in R and interpreting the output of these. If not, we recommend you consult the previous course in this series - **Introduction to Regression with R**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive network visualisation below displays the prerequisite structure for this course within the training program. Each node represents a course that you may need to complete beforehand, and the arrows show the recommended order in which to take them, leading up to your selected course. You can click on any course node to view more information about that course. This interactive tool helps you clearly see the learning path required to access this course, making it easier to plan your progress with the Coding for Reproducible Research Training (CfRR) initiative."
