    "## Course description \n",
    "\n",
    "This course is designed to introduce core machine learning concepts. Students will explore the machine learning landscape, and the main stages of the machine learning pipeline. They will learn about model selection, error, evaluation and validation, and put all of these into practice using Python. `Scikit-learn` will be introduced, and used to pre-process data, train models, and build pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explain the main theoretical concepts of machine learning (at a high level), the machine learning landscape, and be able to provide some examples of machine learning applications.\n",
    "* Train basic linear models using `scikit-learn`, building understanding of model-based learning.\n",
    "* Understand concepts such as model selection, error, evaluation, validation, and be able to put these into practice with Python.\n",
    "* Explain the main stages of the machine learning pipeline, and be able to create a pipeline running on real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisite knowledge\n",
    "Attendees should have taken the Introduction to Python course described [Intro To Python](intro_to_python.ipynb), and Python for Data Analysis described [Python for Data Analysis](python_for_data_analysis.ipynb).\n",

    "The interactive network visualisation below displays the prerequisite structure for this course within the training program. Each node represents a course that you may need to complete beforehand, and the arrows show the recommended order in which to take them, leading up to your selected course. You can click on any course node to view more information about that course. This interactive tool helps you clearly see the learning path required to access this course, making it easier to plan your progress with the Coding for Reproducible Research Training (CfRR) initiative."
