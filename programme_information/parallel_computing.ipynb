    "\n",
    "## Course Objectives \n",
    "On completion of this series of workshops, participants will:\n",
    "- Be able to explain what is meant by distributed and shared-memory parallelism.\n",
    "- Know how to write software that can run across multiple processes using MPI.\n",
    "- Be able to write code that utilizes multithreading for parallel execution.\n",

    "## Installation Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do now have a working Python installation on your machine (you can check this with ```which python```), you can follow the [Intro To Python](intro_to_python.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing MPI\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Message Passing Interface* (MPI) is a standard for passing messages between multiple networked processes running a parallel program. As MPI is a standard, rather than a piece of software, there is not a single software package that you need to install. There are a few different 'flavours' of MPI, and the majority of HPC systems will have their own versions which are tuned for their specific systems. It is highly recommended that you use a system's built-in MPI libraries if they are available, but if not let's go through the process of installing an MPI library.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "**Requirements**  \n",
    "For this workshop, you will need a multi-core machine which can run a Unix-based terminal (i.e. Linux/WSL or Mac).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MacOS MPI installation\n",
    "MPI can be easily installed with Homebrew. Check your machine has homebrew installed with\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ which brew\n",
    "```\n",
    "If this returns the location of the `brew` executable, then you can proceed with:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ brew install open-mpi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linux/WSL MPI installation\n",
    "There are two ways to ways to install MPI on Linux or WSL platforms is using the `Spack` package manager (this can also be done for MacOS but requires some additional steps), or using `conda`. Each of these two methods will be explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using Spack package manager\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we can install OpenMPI, which is a free and open source MPI implementation. OpenMPI can be installed in a number of different ways, but the recommended way is to use the Spack HPC package manager, which is in a class of its own in the way it handles different MPI implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spack is really simple to install, all you need to need to do is clone the Spack repository:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git clone --depth=100 --branch=releases/v0.21 https://github.com/spack/spack.git ~/spack\n",
    "```\n",
    "and `source` the included setup script:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ source ~/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "Every time you want to use Spack you will need to `source` this script, so it may be easier to add this to your shell login script, (i.e. ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.).\n",
    "We need to let Spack find any compilers in our system, which we can do with:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ spack compiler find\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Next you have to install MPI with spack. This method requires you to have a working set of compilers for C and Fortran. If you don't have these on your system the simplest way to get them is to install them using your system package manager.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Spack to install an MPI library, which will default to installing OpenMPI. If we run\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ spack spec mpi\n",
    "```\n",
    "we can see what Spack will install, and we can use\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ spack install mpi\n",
    "```\n",
    "to execute the installation. Once this is done, we can load the new mpi module with\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ spack load mpi\n",
    "```\n",
    "and check the installation with\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ which mpirun\n",
    "```\n",
    "This command tells us where the `mpirun` command has been installed, which is the primary way that we can launch an executable across multiple process with MPI. With the installation complete we are ready to run some programs with MPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using Conda package manager\n",
    "\n",
    "First download the Miniforge installer from https://conda-forge.org/miniforge/ . Then run the installer using bash within your WSL terminal:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ bash Miniforge3-xx.x.x-x-<operating-system>-x86_64.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next create a conda environment and then activate the conda base environment.\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ conda activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now create a new environment, for example, named mpi_env\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ conda activate\n",
    "$ conda create -n mpi_env python=3.9  # Replace 3.9 with your desired Python version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally install OpenMPI:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ conda install -c conda-forge openmpi openmpi-mpicc openmpi-mpicxx openmpi-mpifort compilers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing MPI for Python (MPI4Py)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have installed MPI, either via spack or conda, the next step is install a Python interface to this library. There are many different interfaces to MPI for many different languages, but we've chosen Python for the benefits it provides to write examples in an easy-to-understand format. Whilst the specific syntax of the commands learned in this part of the course wont be applicable across different languages, the overall code structures and concepts are highly transferable, so once you have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of MPI you should be able to take those concepts to any language with an MPI interface and write parallel code!\n",
    "\n",
    "The python package that we will be using in this course to implement MPI command is the [MPI4Py package](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). To install the package, make sure you have loaded your spack or conda environment with the MPI library install. \n",
    "\n",
    "The MPI4Py package can be installed via pip as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install mpi4py\n",
    "```"
