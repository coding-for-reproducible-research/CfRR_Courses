    "# Introduction to Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Description \n",
    "\n",
    "Version control systems are an incredibly valuable tool for organising software development. They are essential for producing reproducible and transparent research software, coming into their own for facilitating collaborative work. This course will give an introduction to Git, one of the most widely used version control systems in academia and industry. It will also give an introduction to internet platforms such as GitHub and GitLab, which are built on top of Git and designed to facilitate collaboration between software developers and the sharing of code. A key component of the course will be hands-on practice using Git and GitHub, working through theoretical concepts that will be explained with the aid of live demonstrations. By the end of the course, it is intended participants will be comfortable using the basic features of Git and GitHub to keep a record of their day-to-day code development and share their work with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Objectives\n",
    "- Use Git to manage their software development.\n",
    "- Explain what repositories and commits are in Git.\n",
    "- Apply standard Git commands as part of their development workflow: cloning, pulling from and pushing to repositories; adding and committing file changes.\n",
    "- Give examples of what should and should not be included in Git repositories.\n",
    "- Describe how Git and platforms like GitHub and GitLab relate to each other and their differences.\n",
    "- Understand how to share their work with others and/or make it publicly available through GitHub.\n",
    "- Have the confidence to learn more advanced features of Git and GitHub as required for their work, such as working with branches and pull requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Familiarity of working at a Unix command line (e.g. Apple Terminal, a terminal running Bash) is helpful but not essential. A good introduction to this topic more generally can be found at the sister course - *Introduction to Unix*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control systems are primarily used for source code development, so experience writing some code (e.g. R, Python, LaTeX, bash scripts, C,â€¦) is helpful, though not essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "- An installation of Git on your computer.\n",
    "- A GitHub account.\n",

    "  <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noreferrer\">Visual Studio Code</a>\n",
    "  is recommended as it will be used during the workshop sessions, but you\n",
    "  can use another program if you prefer; see the discussion below for\n",
    "  more information.\n",

    "### Installing Git\n",
    "\n",
    "You should first check whether you have Git installed on your computer, according\n",
    "to your operating system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Windows:** Search for the application _Git Bash_ on your computer. (You can\n",
    "  open up a new search by pressing the Windows and <kbd>S</kbd> keys together.) If you\n",
    "  find _Git Bash_ as an application, then you already have Git installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MacOS & Linux:** Open a terminal and run the command `git --version`. If\n",
    "  you get a response that looks something like\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```output\n",
    "  git version 2.25.1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  then you have Git installed (your version number may differ). On the other\n",
    "  hand, if you get a response that says something like\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```output\n",
    "  Command 'git' not found\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  then Git is not installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have Git installed then you will need to install it. Instructions and\n",
    "recommended sources for doing this are provided below, according to operating\n",
    "systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Download and install the latest version of *Git for Windows* from\n",
    "<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/download/win\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noreferrer\">https://git-scm.com/download/win</a>.\n",
    "Accept the default settings while running the installer, with the following\n",
    "optional exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the *Select Components* pane, you may wish to select the option to\n",
    "  *Check daily for Git for Windows updates*. Selecting this will mean Git for\n",
    "  Windows will tell you when a new update for it is available.\n",
    "- On the *Choosing the default editor used by Git* pane, you can select\n",
    "  a different text editor that will be used to write\n",
    "  'commit messages' in Git. The default text editor, Vim, is difficult to\n",
    "  use if you're not used to it. Nano is a much simpler text editor that works\n",
    "  from the command line, so our recommendation would be to switch to that. The\n",
    "  choice of text editor can be changed later once Git is installed, so you're not\n",
    "  tied in by your choice here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mac OS\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend installing Git through the\n",
    "*Xcode Command Line Tools*. This is a collection of software, curated by\n",
    "Apple, that is useful for developing code on MacOS; Git is one of the programs\n",
    "included. Daniel Kehoe has \n",
    "<a href=\"https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noreferrer\">a very good guide</a>\n",
    "on the Xcode Command Line Tools. Daniel's guide recommends installing the\n",
    "<a href=\"https://brew.sh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noreferrer\">Homebrew</a>\n",
    "package manager at the same time as the Xcode Command Line Tools,\n",
    "however this is not required for installing Git, so we instead recommend following\n",
    "<a href=\"https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/4.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noreferrer\"> the version of his instructions that avoids installing Homebrew</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "Install Git using your operating system's package manager. See\n",
    "<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/download/linux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noreferrer\">https://git-scm.com/download/linux</a>\n",
    "for instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get a GitHub account\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up an account, go to\n",
    "<a href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noreferrer\">https://github.com/</a>\n",
    "and click on *Sign Up* in the top right-hand corner. Make sure you know your\n",
    "username and password for the start of the course!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text editors / IDEs\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also have a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE)\n",
    "installed on your computer, to give you a means of editing text files and source\n",
    "code. Throughout this course we will be using\n",
    "<a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noreferrer\">Visual Studio Code</a>\n",
    "(a.k.a. VS Code) because it has nice integration with Git (it's also free and\n",
    "works on most operating systems). One or two parts of the course will use\n",
    "features in VS Code to better visualise what is going on with Git (such as\n",
    "visualising differences between file versions), so you will likely find it\n",
    "simplest to use VS Code to follow along in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you don't want to use VS Code then you can use whatever text editor / IDE\n",
    "you feel comfortable with. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notepad++\n",
    "- Sublime Text \n",
    "- Emacs\n",
    "- RStudio (includes Git integration)\n",
    "- PyCharm (includes Git integration)\n",
    "- (At the command line) Vim, Nano\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wish to see if your preferred text editor / IDE has integrations\n",
    "with Git, or if there are plugins or other extensions that add capabilities for\n",
    "working with Git from within your text editor / IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Head to <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noreferrer\">https://code.visualstudio.com</a> to download and install VS Code for your operating system.\n",
    "Windows users can also install it from the Microsoft Store.\n",
