    "## Course Description \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is one of the most popular general-purpose programming languages around. It is used in a huge range of applications, from building systems incorporating cutting-edge machine learning, such as in self-driving cars, to building web applications with hundreds of millions of users, as seen in Instagram. As researchers, we use Python for all manner of tasks, from data analysis, to automation, to prototyping software, to creating engaging visuals for websites and publications. Like you, we started our journey into Python learning the basics, building a strong foundation for achieving these more complex tasks. This introductory course will teach you these basics, and get you up to speed on your own programming journeys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Objectives\n",
    "- Understand and declare the basic data types in Python.\n",
    "- Understand the basic principles of control flow and for loops.\n",
    "- Describe what a function is and define one that takes user-specified parameters.\n",
    "- Perform simple data analysis/visualisation of a table of data.\n",
    "- Recognise concepts in other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisite Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "No pre-requisite knowledge needed. However, course attendees will need to follow our setup guide to install Python and JupyterLab, which we will use for the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sign-up \n",
    "\n",
    "To check for upcoming course dates and to register, please visit the [Workshop Schedule and Sign-up](../cfrr_program_details/courses_overview.ipynb) page."

    "## Installation Guide \n",
    "\n",
    "All CfRR courses require attendees to use their own computer/laptop to follow workshop activities and take effective notes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> We are currently reviewing our installation instructions for this course. The following instructions can be used for current editions of the course, but may change in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimal requirements for this course are an up-to-date web browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). Participants can optionally run Python on their own machines through either Anaconda (Option 1 below) or Miniforge (Option 3 below).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use JupyterLab - a browser-based text editor - to edit code. This is provided through the various installation options below, so you do not need to do anything extra to get this. The course instructor will cover how to start JupyterLab and create _Jupyter notebook_ (`.ipynb`) files in the sessions. For those who have installed Anaconda on their laptops (Option 1), we have included a guide to launching JupyterLab below in case you want to try this yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: (Windows) University-managed Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "For those using a University-issued Windows laptop, we advise colleagues to install Anaconda via the University's centrally managed software catalogue (Company Portal) where possible. Click on the Windows icon in the toolbar and search for 'Company Portal' to find this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Online JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "If option 1 is not possible or convenient for you, then we suggest you use an online version of JupyterLab. All that is required is a web browser and internet connection to use this. Visit [https://jupyter.org/try](https://jupyter.org/try) and click on the card the says [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/). This provides all the functionality we will need for this course and you can download the files you create after each session for later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Launching JupyterLab from Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "To launch JupyterLab, we first need to start up **Anaconda Navigator**. This can be done by searching for Anaconda Navigator in your system search bar, and clicking on the green, circular icon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this has opened, click the JupyterLab launch button, as below. Please note that this is different from selecting \"Notebook\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![A screenshot of the Anaconda Navigator interface. The main window displays a grid of applications, each with an icon, name, and brief description. Applications visible include \"DataSpell,\" \"CMD.exe Prompt,\" \"JupyterLab,\" \"Notebook,\" \"Powershell Prompt,\" \"IPython,\" \"Spyder,\" and \"VS Code.\" A green circle highlights the \"Launch\" button for \"JupyterLab.\" On the left sidebar, there are navigation options like \"Home,\" \"Environments,\" \"Learning,\" and \"Community.\"](images/AnacondaNavigator.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This should launch a web browser and open a tab for JupyterLab. The title of the tab will be JupyterLab. It will look something like the following image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A screenshot of the JupyterLab interface. The left sidebar shows a file browser with a \"Desktop/Python\" directory selected, containing a \"main.py\" file modified \"19 minutes ago.\" The main area of the interface displays a \"Launcher\" tab, offering options to create a \"Notebook,\" \"Python 3 (ipykernel)\" console, or other computational environments.](images/JupyterLab.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other ways to launch JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "If you installed Anaconda, you can also launch JupyterLab from the command line. If you're on Windows, search for the application Anaconda Prompt and open it and type the following. On macOS or Linux, open a terminal window, and type the same command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter lab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To quit JupyterLab, hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>C</kbd> (you may need to do this a couple of times).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also see that you have Python installed using the same terminal type: from Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or a terminal window (Mac / Linux) type\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see something similar to `Python 3...`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "- My browser isn't showing anything and I cannot change browser!\n",
    "  - From\n",
    "    [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47772157/how-to-change-the-default-browser-used-by-Jupyter-notebook-in-windows)\n",
    "    the basic answer is to create a config file and specify the browser.\n",
    "    A config file can be created with\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Jupyter notebook --generate-config\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Then the ```c.NotebookApp.browser``` and ```c.ServerApp.browser``` options can be set to the appropriate browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the difference between JupyterLab and a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "  - JupyterLab is an editor (or integrated development environment, IDE) which\n",
    "    can be used to create and edit notebooks and scripts.\n",
    "  - A notebook is a particular format of script that allows code and text blocks\n",
    "    to be interwoven. The code blocks can be executed in line to show their\n",
    "    answers. This is a helpful format for explaining, demonstrating and exploring\n",
    "    methods, and commonly used in research & teaching environments.\n",
