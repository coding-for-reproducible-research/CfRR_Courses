    "# Advanced Regression Analysis With R\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Description \n",
    "\n",
    "This course builds on your existing knowledge of regression to fit more complex models that can handle more complicated data sets. In this session you will learn about different types of regression analysis, when to use them, and how to interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Objectives \n",
    "-   Use regression answer to answer a wide range of research questions.\n",
    "-   Learn to fit a regression model with interactions between predictor variables.\n",
    "-   Learn to fit multi-level regression models.\n",
    "-   Extract and summarise the results from a range of regression models.\n",
    "-   Learn to design a regression model appropriate for the participant's specific research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisite Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will not include an introduction to R, or how to setup and use R or Rstudio. It is assumed you are comfortable coding in R and are familiar with:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   How to write and execute commands in the R console.\n",
    "-   What type of variables are available in R and how to work with these.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also assume that you are comfortable with fitting in R and interpreting the output of:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Simple linear regression.\n",
    "-   Multiple linear regression with categorical, binary or continuous predictor variables.\n",
    "-   Logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "If not, we recommend that you consult our pre-requisite course [Introductory Regression Analysis with R](regression_analysis_with_r.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Signup \n",
    "\n",
    "To check for upcoming course dates and to register, please visit the Workshop Schedule and Signup page available [here](../cfrr_program_details/courses_overview.ipynb)."
