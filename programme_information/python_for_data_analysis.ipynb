    "## Installation Guide \n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, attendees will need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Python** programming language\n",
    "- A way to **edit and run code** (we will use **JupyterLab** in a web browser)\n",
    "- An up-to-date **web browser**. We recommend a current version of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Edge, with the course team generally using Chrome. \n",
    "\n",
    "This guide shows how to set everything up using the command line, with a focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Installing Python\n",
    "- Creating and using a dedicated Python environment (so we avoid global installs)\n",
    "- Installing the course requirements\n",
    "- Starting JupyterLab from the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "For more background on Python environments and why we use them, see the CfRR short course on the topic: [CfRR Short Course on Python Environments](../short_courses/python_environments)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Overview of the tools we will use\n",
    "\n",
    "During the course you will primarily use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A terminal / command line:\n",
    "  - Windows: Command Prompt or PowerShell\n",
    "  - macOS: Terminal\n",
    "  - Linux: your preferred terminal\n",
    "- Python 3\n",
    "- A virtual environment in the course folder: `.venv`\n",
    "- JupyterLab, launched from the command line with `jupyter lab`\n",
    "- A modern web browser\n",
    "\n",
    "We deliberately do not rely on Anaconda Navigator or other GUI launchers, as was used in the Introduction to Python, to keep the process consistent and reproducible across platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Install Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Check if Python is already installed\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal / command prompt and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If that doesn’t work, try:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you see something like `Python 3.10.x` or higher, you already have a usable version.\n",
    "- If you get an error, you’ll need to install Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Install Python on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visit <https://www.python.org/downloads/>.\n",
    "2. Download the latest Python 3 installer for Windows.\n",
    "3. Run the installer and tick:\n",
    "\n",
    "   > ✅ *Add python.exe to PATH*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Choose “Install Now” and accept the defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, open Command Prompt or PowerShell and check:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to check `python3 --version`. You should now see the version that you installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3 Install Python on macOS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visit <https://www.python.org/downloads/>.\n",
    "2. Download the latest Python 3 installer for macOS.\n",
    "3. Run the `.pkg` installer and follow the prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then open Terminal and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to check `python3 --version`. You should now see the version that you installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.4 Install Python on Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "On many Linux systems, Python 3 is already installed. Check with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If it is missing, install Python 3 (and the `venv` module) using your package manager. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt update\n",
    "sudo apt install python3 python3-venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Create a dedicated Python environment (`.venv`)\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep your system clean and make the course setup reproducible, we will create a Python **virtual environment** in the course folder. This environment will hold all the packages used in the course and avoid global installs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1 Create the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In the directory where you plan to conduct your work, run one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# If 'python' runs Python 3 on your system:\n",
    "python -m venv .venv\n",
    "\n",
    "# If you need to use 'python3':\n",
    "python3 -m venv .venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a folder named `.venv` that contains its own Python interpreter and installed packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Activate the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "You must activate the environment each time you open a new terminal before working on the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the environment is active, you will see `(.venv)` at the start of your prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.1 macOS / Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "From the folder you created the environment in, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your prompt should now look something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "(.venv) yourname@computer <directory> %\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To deactivate the environment later:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.2 Windows – Command Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "From the folder you created the environment in, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bat\n",
    ".\\.venv\\Scripts\u0007ctivate.bat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt will change to something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "(.venv) C:\\Users\\you\\folder>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To deactivate:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bat\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.3 Windows – PowerShell\n",
    "\n",
    "From the folder you created the environment in, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    ".\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see a message about execution policy, you may need to allow local scripts:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then try activating again.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Install the course requirements inside `.venv`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will **manually** install the core Python libraries we need, so you can clearly see what is being installed and can repeat the process for your own projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key libraries we will use are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NumPy** – efficient numerical computing with arrays  \n",
    "- **pandas** – working with tabular data (data frames)  \n",
    "- **Matplotlib** – creating plots and figures  \n",
    "- **scikit-learn** – basic machine learning and modelling  \n",
    "- **JupyterLab** – running notebooks in your browser  \n",
    "\n",
    "From inside the folder you have created, with the environment **activated**, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyterlab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command installs NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn and JupyterLab into `.venv` only, keeping your system Python clean and making your setup reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using additional plotting or analysis libraries later, you can install them in the same way, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install seaborn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can inspect what’s installed with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Step 6 – Launch JupyterLab from the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use **JupyterLab** as our main editor and environment for running Python code during the course. JupyterLab runs in your web browser but is started from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.1 Starting JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a terminal / command prompt.\n",
    "2. Go to your course folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd /path/to/folder\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Activate your environment (`.venv`) as described above.\n",
    "4. Once you see `(.venv)` in your prompt, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   jupyter lab\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start a local Jupyter server.\n",
    "- Open a tab in your web browser titled **“JupyterLab”**.\n",
    "- Show a menu where you can create a new notebook, open a terminal, and many other actions. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can close JupyterLab by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shutting down the server in the terminal with `Ctrl+C` and confirming, and\n",
    "- Closing the browser tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key point:** Always activate `.venv` before running `jupyter lab` so that Jupyter uses the correct Python and packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.2 Jupyter Notebook vs JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "- **JupyterLab** is an editor / integrated development environment (IDE) where you can:\n",
    "  - Browse files\n",
    "  - Create and edit Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "  - Open terminals\n",
    "  - Work with multiple notebooks and scripts side by side\n",
    "- A **Jupyter notebook** (`.ipynb` file) is a document format that mixes:\n",
    "  - Code cells (which you can run)\n",
    "  - Text (Markdown) cells\n",
    "  - Outputs (figures, tables, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are widely used in research and teaching for explaining, demonstrating, and exploring methods. JupyterLab is the modern environment in which you interact with these notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer the classic notebook interface, you can launch it instead with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(Still after activating `.venv`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional: Using VS Code instead of JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "While this course uses **JupyterLab** as the primary environment for running and interacting with notebooks, **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** is also a widely used and fully supported option for Python development. Participants are therefore welcome to use VS Code if it better fits their existing workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "VS Code can be used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open and edit Python scripts (`.py`) and Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`)\n",
    "- Run code using the same virtual environment (`.venv`) created for this course\n",
    "- Work with notebooks directly inside the editor using the Jupyter extension\n",
    "- Combine notebooks, scripts, terminals, and file browsing in a single interface\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using VS Code with this course\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Install VS Code and required extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download and install VS Code from:  \n",
    "   https://code.visualstudio.com/\n",
    "2. Open VS Code.\n",
    "3. Install the following extensions when prompted, or via the Extensions panel:\n",
    "   - **Python** (by Microsoft)\n",
    "   - **Jupyter** (by Microsoft)\n",
    "\n",
    "These extensions enable Python execution, environment selection, and notebook support.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Open the course folder in VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In VS Code, select **File → Open Folder…**\n",
    "2. Choose the folder where you created the `.venv` environment.\n",
    "3. VS Code will load the folder and detect the virtual environment automatically in many cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important:** The `.venv` folder must be inside the project directory for VS Code to detect it reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Select the correct Python interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "VS Code must be configured to use the Python interpreter from `.venv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).\n",
    "2. Search for **Python: Select Interpreter**.\n",
    "3. Choose the interpreter that points to:\n",
    "   - `.venv/bin/python` (macOS/Linux), or\n",
    "   - `.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe` (Windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once selected, VS Code will use this interpreter for running scripts and notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Working with Jupyter notebooks in VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "You can open and run Jupyter notebooks directly inside VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open an existing `.ipynb` file, or create a new one via **File → New File → Jupyter Notebook**.\n",
    "2. At the top right of the notebook interface, locate the **Kernel Picker**.\n",
    "3. Select the kernel associated with the `.venv` environment (it should match the interpreter selected above).\n",
    "4. Run cells using the **Run** button or by pressing `Shift+Enter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs such as plots and tables will appear inline, in the same way as in JupyterLab.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key point:** If your code cannot find installed packages, double-check that the selected kernel is the one associated with `.venv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Using the integrated terminal in VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "VS Code includes an integrated terminal that can be used in place of a separate system terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the terminal via **Terminal → New Terminal**.\n",
    "2. Activate the environment if it is not already active:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux\n",
    "   .\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate    # Windows\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. Once activated, you can run:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   jupyter lab\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   or execute Python scripts and commands as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6. VS Code vs JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "- **JupyterLab** provides a browser-based environment designed specifically for notebooks and teaching workflows.\n",
    "- **VS Code** provides a general-purpose development environment that integrates notebooks, scripts, version control, and terminals in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both tools use the same underlying Python environment and packages. The course documentation defaults to JupyterLab to ensure a consistent, platform-independent experience, but the concepts, commands, and examples apply equally when using VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Recommendation:** If you are new to Python or notebook-based workflows, we recommend following the course using JupyterLab. If you already use VS Code for Python development, you may continue to do so using the same `.venv` environment.\n",
