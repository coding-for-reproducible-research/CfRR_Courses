    "## Course description \n",
    "\n",
    "Reproducibility is a core feature of successful research software development and data science projects. Fully reproducible workflows can be created by integrating data with code and outputs using a special type of text language called \"Markdown\". This course will introduce you to the Markdown language and conceptualise the benefits towards ensuring reproducibility in coding-based research activities. You will also gain hands-on experience of creating reproducible Markdown documents using R: a popular coding environment used in research software development and data science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this workshop you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Describe what Markdown is and why it is useful\n",
    "2. Recognise the main components of a Markdown document\n",
    "3. Use basic Markdown syntax\n",
    "4. Generate Markdown documents using R/RStudio\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisite knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "You are not expected to be familiar with either the Markdown language or creating Markdown documents in R prior to attending this workshop. You are also not required to be an advanced user of R. However, a basic working knowledge of R programming is beneficial. As such, you are encouraged to work through our [Intro To R](intro_to_r.ipynb) (either by attending the course or *via* independent self-study) prior to attending this particular workshop.\n",

    "The interactive network visualisation below displays the prerequisite structure for this course within the training program. Each node represents a course that you may need to complete beforehand, and the arrows show the recommended order in which to take them, leading up to your selected course. You can click on any course node to view more information about that course. This interactive tool helps you clearly see the learning path required to access this course, making it easier to plan your progress with the Coding for Reproducible Research Training (CfRR) initiative."
