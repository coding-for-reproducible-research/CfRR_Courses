    "## Course Description \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "R is a programming language and software environment primarily focused on performing statistics, data analysis and visualisation. This course will provide an all-purpose introduction to the R programming language and may provide an accessible entry to computer programming in general. Throughout the workshop participants will be taught using RStudio, and will be introduced to best practices from the beginning, including how to document your work in a script. Over three sessions you will learn how to import, manage and process data for statistical analysis and visualisation. At the end of the workshop the participants will have a solid understanding of how to run R commands and the properties of R objects, providing a solid basis for self-guided learning of more complex analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Objectives\n",
    "- Learn how to use Rstudio to write scripts and run R commands.\n",
    "- Learn the different types of objects for storing data and the importance of different data types.\n",
    "- Know how to read in data, manipulate it and save the output.\n",
    "- Know how to visualise data in commonly used figures.\n",
    "- Understand how to perform some basic inferential statistical tests.\n",
    "- Learn definitions of fundamental programming terminology and concepts such as variable, function and for loops that are transferable to other programming languages.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Pre-requisite Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a course for novices so there is no pre-requisite knowledge.\n",

    "## Installation Guide \n",
    "\n",
    "All CfRR courses require attendees to use their own computer/laptop to follow workshop activities and take effective notes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because R and RStudio work together, you need to install them both. The steps in this section should guide you through the process. Once installed, you will be working with RStudio and R will be running in the background. If you are using a University of Exeter Windows machine there is the option to install with the [Company Portal software](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/departments/it/new/companyportal/) if you are having issues with admin rights. You shuold be able to search for R/Rstudio and install it as per the instructions on the University website. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Install R?\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing R in 5  steps:\n",
    "- **Step 1.** Go to: https://www.r-project.org/\n",
    "- **Step 2**: Click on **CRAN** or **download R**.\n",
    "    - *Note:* You'll only do this once, although, eventually you'll have to update to the most recent version. Follow the same procedure as today.\n",
    "- **Step 3.** Select a mirror. A *Mirror* is a server somewhere in the world with a copy of the program. Choose the mirror closest to you. For example, if you are in the UK, you can select the one from University of Bristol. Don't worry too much about this.\n",
    "- **Step 4.** Select the download appropriate for your computer (Microsoft, Mac or Linux)\n",
    "- **Step 5.** Open the program you downloaded and follow the instructions\n",
    "    - *Note* - There is another tutorial identical to this one that shows the process you need to follow if you have a mac.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Install RStudio?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, you need to install both R and RStudio. Follow this four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1**: Go to: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/\n",
    "- **Step 2**: Click on the free version **Download** button.\n",
    "- **Step 2** Select your download accordingly. \n",
