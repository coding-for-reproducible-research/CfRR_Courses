    "# Introduction to GPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview \n",
    "Welcome to the Introduction to GPU Programming course! This course has been designed to give you a practical foundation in GPU computing for scientific and technical applications. You will learn the essential concepts of GPU architectures, explore how to run code on modern accelerators, and develop hands-on skills in managing environments, running jobs on HPC systems, and optimising performance. The focus will be on applying these skills through guided exercises and projects in numerical modelling and simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Objectives\n",
    "- Understand the fundamental principles of GPU architectures and parallel programming models.  \n",
    "- Configure and manage software environments for GPU computing using **Spack**.  \n",
    "- Submit and manage GPU-enabled jobs on HPC systems with **Slurm**.  \n",
    "- Diagnose performance bottlenecks using profiling tools, and apply strategies for performance optimisation.  \n",
    "- Implement GPU-accelerated numerical models, such as a **temperature diffusion solver**.  \n",
    "- Apply knowledge to a capstone project, extending **Conway’s Game of Life** to explore GPU performance, scalability, and custom extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisite Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "- An account on ISCA\n",
    "- Attended [Introduction to HPC](../individual_modules/section_landing_pages/introduction_to_hpc.md) or equivalent experience.\n",
    "- Attended [Introduction to UNIX](../individual_modules/section_landing_pages/introduction_to_unix.md) or equivalent experience.\n",
    "- Attended [Introduction to Python](../individual_modules/section_landing_pages/introduction_to_python.md) or equivalent experience. \n",
