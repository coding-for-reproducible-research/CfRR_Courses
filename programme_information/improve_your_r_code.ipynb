    "# Improve Your R Code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "R is primarily known as a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. However, its flexibility and accessibility have led to widespread use across disciplines including biosciences, medicine, and social sciences. This workshop is designed to help learners **improve the style and speed** of their R code. It is aimed at individuals who already write R scripts and want to develop more maintainable and performant code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this workshop, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be able to write clean, readable, and maintainable R code following the tidyverse style guide.\n",
    "- Be able to measure and benchmark code performance using `microbenchmark`.\n",
    "- Understand and apply tools such as `parallel`, `data.table`, and `Rcpp` to improve execution speed.\n",
    "- Use `styler` to automatically format and clean your code.\n",
    "- Understand when optimisation is appropriate and how to identify performance bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisite Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will not include an introduction to R, or how to setup and use R or Rstudio. It is assumed you are comfortable coding in R and are familiar with:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Writing and executing commands in the R console.\n",
    "-   Writing functions in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "If not we recommend that you consult our pre-requisite course **Introduction to R**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "Please install and load the following R packages:\n",
    "```\n",
    "data.table\n",
    "dplyr\n",
    "learnr\n",
    "microbenchmark\n",
    "parallel\n",
    "parallelly\n",
    "Rcpp\n",
    "styler\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### learnr \n",
    "A interactive learnr tutorial can be downloaded by executing the following commands in R:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "install.packages(\"devtools\") \n",
    "install.packages(\"learnr\") \n",
    "library(devtools)\n",
    "library(learnr)\n",
    "learnr::run_tutorial(\"Improve Your R Code\", \"cfrrRtutorials\", clean = TRUE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can navigate through the sections using the menu on the side. The sections on speed are based on [Measuring Performance](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/perf-measure.html) and [Improving Performance](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/perf-improve.html) by Hadley Wickham.\n",
