    "# Introduction to Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Description\n",
    "Welcome to the Introduction to Julia course! This course has been created to give you an idea of Julia's particular language features. It assumes you are already comfortable with the basics of programming, allowing for more detailed and interesting topics to be discussed. To be able to best engage with this course, it is therefore recommended that you are familiar with the content in both \"Introduction to Python\" and \"Python for Data Analysis\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Objectives\n",
    "- Understand Julia’s design philosophy and interact fluently with its REPL, including both the package and help modes.\n",
    "- Define and manipulate basic data types and variables, and apply control-flow constructs (`if`, `for`, `while`) to express algorithmic logic.  \n",
    "- Encapsulate functionality in Julia functions, leveraging multiple dispatch to write clean, type-specific methods.  \n",
    "- Work with arrays and matrices, perform element-wise and linear algebra operations, and harness Julia’s native array abstractions for efficient numerical computing.  \n",
    "- Read from and write to external data sources using Julia’s I/O facilities, and parse or format data in common file formats.  \n",
    "- Create informative visualizations of data and simulation output with `Plots.jl` (and other graphics packages).  \n",
    "- Manage project dependencies and packages using Julia’s built-in package manager (`Pkg`), and organize your code into multi-file, reproducible projects.  \n",
    "- Diagnose and eliminate performance bottlenecks by profiling your code, preallocating buffers, using `@inbounds`/`@simd`, and choosing efficient data structures (e.g. `BitMatrix`).  \n",
    "- Apply your skills to a capstone project, implementing and optimizing Conway’s Game of Life from first principles, and extending it with custom rules, GUIs, or advanced visualizations.\n",
    "## Pre-requisite Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "Attendees of the workshop should already be familiar with a programming language and should have already installed and been able to run an example of a Julia code snippet. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Sign-up \n",
    "\n",
    "To check for upcoming course dates and to register, please visit the Workshop Schedule and Sign-up page available [here](../cfrr_program_details/courses_overview.ipynb)."
