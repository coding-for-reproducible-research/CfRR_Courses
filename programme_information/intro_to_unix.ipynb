    "# Introduction to Unix\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Description \n",
    "The Unix system and the shell predate most computational interfaces (e.g. the graphical user interface). Although very old, Unix-based systems and the shell are one of the most powerful ways to use computers - whether it is your laptop or a supercomputer. This course is an introduction to navigating your way around the shell and demonstrating how it can improve your workflow. This can be in the form of data processing, executing code, using a huge range of built-in tools, and creating pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Objectives\n",
    "- Describe what the shell is and how to access it.\n",
    "- Navigate around the Unix filesystem.\n",
    "- Inspect and manipulate files.\n",
    "- Automate tasks via scripts.\n",
    "- Run programs outside of IDEs and notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisite Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "No prior coding knowledge required.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Signup \n",
    "\n",
    "To check for upcoming course dates and to register, please visit the Workshop Schedule and Signup page available [here](../cfrr_program_details/courses_overview.ipynb)."

    "### Download files\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to download some files to follow this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download [Download Course Materials](course_materials/shell-lesson-data.zip) and move the file to your Desktop.\n",
    "2. Unzip/extract the file.\n",
