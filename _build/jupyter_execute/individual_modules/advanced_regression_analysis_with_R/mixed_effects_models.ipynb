    "# Mixed Effects Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use a mixed effects model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard linear regression models make the assumption that the data used to fit the model are randomly selected from the population. By randomly we mean that all pairs of samples are equally different. Another way of thinking about this is that there is no reason why knowing the outcome of one sample would make it easier for us to predict the outcome of another sample. This is not always the case, and indeed there are times when we want to use data where there are relationships between the observations or some underlying structure to the data. This might be deliberate and part of the study design e.g. family or longitudinal studies, or alternatively it may be a consequence of poor study design or unforeseen recruitment bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we force a standard regression model that makes this assumption onto these type of data, we run the risk of our results being biased and the wrong conclusion being made. One work around is to filter our data so that it only contains independent samples, but this seems a bit of waste of valuable data that contains additional information that could improve the fit of our model. Instead it would be preferable to use a methodology that can appropriately model the underlying structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-level models are designed to deal with nested, grouped, clustered or hierarchical data. These are all synonyms for the same concept that the observations are not independent and there is some underlying structure to the data. This structure may be something you are interested in or just something you want to control for. In genral multi-level models can be considered a more complex regression framework to model:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   structure within data\n",
    "    -   e.g. patients recruited by different consultants from different clinics across the UK\n",
    "-   heterogeneity in variance between groups\n",
    "    -   e.g. post-code specific effects on risk factors for disease\n",
    "-   individual-level and group-level effects\n",
    "    -   e.g. weight influenced by genetics and local access to gyms\n",
    "-   dependencies between observations\n",
    "    -   e.g. educational attainment at age 18 influenced by educational attainment at age 12\n",
    "\n",
    "They are also referred to as mixed effects model, hierarchical linear models, random effects models, random coefficients models, and probably other names.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a mixed effects model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard linear regression models, such as the example below, have one level, and can be referred to as single level regression models, whereby all the data is treated as independent observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for a standard linear regression model between two variables can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{i} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{i} + \\varepsilon_{i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where for observation i:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $y_{i}$ is the outcome variable\n",
    "-   $x_{i}$ is the predictor variable\n",
    "-   $\\beta_{0}$ is the intercept\n",
    "-   $\\beta_{1}$ is the slope coefficient for X\n",
    "-   $\\varepsilon \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)$ is the error\n",
    "\n",
    "Critically all the parameters ($\\beta_{0}$, $\\beta_{1}$) estimated for this model apply to all observations in the sample. There is a single intercept, and single slope coefficient for each predictor variable, and consequently, a single error term. In order to model structure in our data set, whereby some observations get treated differently, we need to expand this formula and introduce new parameters to represent this grouping effect. We use the variance components model, shown below, to include a group level influence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\beta_{0j} = \\beta_{0} + u_{0j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where for observation i, in group j:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $\\beta_{0j}$ represents the mean intercept for group j\n",
    "-   $\\beta_{0}$ is the overall mean\n",
    "-   $u_{0j} \\sim N(0, \\sigma_{u}^2$ is the moderator effect for group j\n",
    "\n",
    "A multi-level model is the combination of both the single level regression model and variance components model. It can be represented as the two equations above, where each equation represents a different level of the data, i.e. one representing the individual level predictors (level 1) and one representing the group level predictors (level 2). Alternatively, we can write as a single equation, by substituting the level 2 equation into the level 1 equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{ij} = \\beta_{0} + u_{0j} + \\beta_{1}x_{ij}  + \\varepsilon_{ij}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From this formula we can see that each group $j$ has it's own intercept value ($\\beta_{0} + u_{0j}$) but every observation has the same slope coefficient ($\\beta_{1}$). We call this a random intercepts model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are fixed and random effects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically when defining or describing to mixed effects models, we consider them to include both fixed and random effects, where variables are assigned to be modeled as either one or the other. Fixed effects assume that the parameter estimates apply to all our observations (i.e. do not depend on j) and we estimate the value of the regression parameters for each variable. The interpretation of these estimated coefficients is as it was in single level regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead for variables classified as having random effects, we are assuming that each group within that variable has it's own effect and that across all the groups the distribution of their effects is normal. For random effects we are interested in estimating the variance of the distribution from which the group effects come. Conceptually random effects must be categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a mixed effects model with one fixed effect and one random effect we have four parameters to estimate using our observed data:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $\\beta_{0}$ (fixed effect)\n",
    "-   $\\beta_{1}$ (fixed effect)\n",
    "-   $\\sigma^{2}_{u}$ (random effect)\n",
    "-   $\\sigma^{2}_{\\varepsilon}$ (random effect)"

    "To enable us to try out some multilevel regression models we have provided some longitudinal data looking at cognitive performance annually for an intervention study. All individuals have multiple entries capturing data collected at different assessments over time. For each individual we have a unique identifier code (`ID`). We have the individual's sex, smoking status, intervention status and years education. We then have a series of columns for the visit data, which includes scores from various cognitive tests `CognitionA`, `CognitionB`, etc as well their age at the time of assessment and physical or mental well being. We can use the `table()` function to tabulate how many visits each individual had, and then the `summary()` and `hist()` functions to calculate some descriptive statistics and plot a histogram of these data."

Many older packages are stored on CRAN[<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/>]. R provides a function to download such packages `install.packages()` where the name of the package is provided as an argument. Multiple packages can be provided as a vector using the `c()` function. The lme4 package we are interested in, can be installed in this way.\n"

    "You may get a pop-up window asking you to choose a mirror (this is not overly important but logical to choose a local UK based mirror). When you install a package some text may be printed to the console, some of which won't be in plain English or easily understandable. You may get a warning say cannot write to the default library directory and R will suggest an alternative which you can choose to accept. Ultimately you should get a message saying `package 'lme4' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked` indicating the installation has worked, it should also tell you where it has installed the package. This information is not important, as it will automatically install it where R can find it, and you shouldn't need to to look at these files. Packages typically build on functionality from other packages and cannot be successfully installed if any packages it depends on are not installed on your system. By default these should be automatically installed along with the package you want. However errors may arise if the packages are hosted in different places and therefore cannot all be installed using the same command. See the end of this document for other methods to install packages from other repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have installed the package we need to load it. As with all other software you install on a computer, it only needs to be installed once and in future R sessions you just need to load the package as follows. The caveat here is if you update the version of R you are using, as the packages are saved in folders relating to the version of R you are using.\n"

    "All packages hosted on CRAN come with a webpage which provides a description of what the package does, details on the version number, who wrote the package and other useful information. All packages also come with a manual which documents all the functions the package contains and some will also have vignettes providing an annotated typical workflow for using the package. These are put together by the package authors and therefore can be variable in how accessible the language is and useful the information is for users. Links to the manual and vignette can be accessed through the package's webpage. The documentation for each function can also be accessed through the help function in R. To fit a mixed effects model we will use the function `lmer`, but before we use it let's see what the help function has to say about it."

    "The output is similar to that from a linear regression model, fitted with `lm()`. It starts with a statement of what type of model and the form of the model fitted. It then gives a summary of the algorithm used to estimate the effects. We have a summary of the scaled residuals (errors), the random effects and fixed effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that there are no p-values in the fixed effects co-efficients table. Significance testing in mixed effects models is not as straight forward as it is for linear regression. Our objective for significance testing of the fixed effects is the same as for standard regression, to see if there is a relationship between the predictor variable and the outcome. We do this by seeing if the data supports the alternative hypothesis that the regression parameter is non-zero (compared to the null hypothesis that it's value is equal to 0). As they are conceptually the same, test statistics for fixed effects can be calculated in the same way as the estimated value of the parameter divided by it's standard error. To go from a test statistic to a p value we need to know what distribution to use and this is where it gets tricky. The challenge is that it is not obvious what distribution these test statistics should follow, and how many degrees of freedom should be applied. It could be influenced by\n",

    "\n",
    "So to determine significance we either need to make an approximation for the degrees of freedom or a perform simulations to establish a distribution which we can use to calculate a p-value. There are methods that have been proposed to calculate approximations for the degrees of freedom (e.g. Kenward-Roger, Satterthwaite) such that the t-distribution can be used in a manner similar to standard regression analysis. Crucially though there is no widely accepted method for calculating degrees of freedom exists. The `lme4` package does not calculate p-values for the coefficients on principle [see discussion](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2006-May/094765.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for many this is not a satisfactory conclusion, so a second package `lmerTest` has been developed, which if loaded alongside lme4, adds p-values to the above table. It is worthwhile noting that, there are multiple methods to calculate p-values, and that might introduce some variation in results across software. More importantly the different methods are based on different assumptions and therefore may introduce misleading results if these are not appropriate for your data set.\n",

    "We can see from the coefficients table, that R has used the t-distribution to calculate p-values for the fixed effects. By default `lmerTest` uses the Satterwaite approximation to calculate the degrees of freedom for this test (stated at the top of the output, alongside the method for estimating the coefficients). In the results we can see that the `VisitNum` variable is significantly positively associated with the performance in cognitive test A (p = `r signif(summary(model.rand.int)$coefficients[\"VisitNum\",5],2)`). We can interpret the parameter for this variable as we would for a standard regression model, where the value represents the change in the outcome for one unit increase in the predictor variable, i.e. the change in score for cognitive test A for each extra visit. Specifically, participants had a mean increase in score of `r signif(summary(model.rand.int)$coefficients[\"VisitNum\",1],2)` per visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also extract information about the variables we fitted as random effects. As described above for these, we are estimating parameters of their distribution and specifically the variance of this distribution. For this model, the variance of the individual intercepts is `r signif(as.data.frame(VarCorr(model.rand.int))[1,\"vcov\"], 3)`. These are hard to attribute much meaning to, but they represent the width of the distribution that the individual effects come from. A larger number implies a wider distribution and consequently more variation in the individual effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also do significance testing of the random effects, to determine if the random intercept is needed. Just because we conceptualize that there should/might be structure in our data doesn't mean that there is or that it's effects are dramatic enough for us to need to model it. Given the complexities of significance testing a fixed effect in a mixed effects model, if we can get away with a simpler regression model, we should favour that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle behind a random effect is that each group needs it's own value taken from a distribution and the effects of the groups can not be represented by a single value (as they would it is was modelled as a fixed effect). Therefore, our null hypothesis (which equates to the random effects not being necessary) requires there to be no distribution of effects, which would occur if the variance of the distribution was 0. The alternative hypothesis (which equates to random effects being necessary) is that there is a distribution and it has a non-zero variance. These situations can be represented below.\n",

    "$$H_{null}: \\sigma_{u}^2 = 0$$ $$H_{alternative}: \\sigma_{u}^2 \\neq 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether we can reject the null hypothesis, we will use the likelihood ratio test to see if the inclusion of the random effect significantly improves the fit of the model. To make this comparison we need to fit a standard linear model with the same fixed effects terms, but omitting the random effect. We can then use the `anova()` function to calculate the test statistics and perform the comparison with the $\\chi^2_{1}$ distribution to calculate a p-value.\n"

    "Looking at the output, we can see two rows, one for each model and the the number of degrees of freedom for the two models is right. If we just look at the p-value it is the same as when we manually coded the anova therefore we might think that we have performed the same analysis. But on closer inspection we can see the log likelihood values and therefore the test statistic are subtly different. This method is in fact using the likelihood statistics from the model fitted using REML, rather than maximum likelihood which is statistically incorrect. We can confirm this by extracting the log likelihood from our lmer model object (which we fitted using REML rather than ML), rather than refitting using maximum likelihood."

    "The second command `coef(model.rand.int)` gives us the intercept and slope values for each level of our grouping variable, one per row. We have only extracted this output for the first six individuals, as otherwise it would run on for pages. This data is stored in a list, where each random variable has it's own slot, within which is a matrix of the regression parameters. As we have only one random variable we have only slot in our list, so it perhaps seems an unnecessary complicated structure, but it is designed to anticipate models with multiple random variables. `lapply()` is a efficiency function in R which allows us to perform the same function to each slot of the list. Here we wanted to run the command `head()` to pull out the first 6 rows, so that we could make the output more manageable and get a sense of what the output looked like.\n",

These individual level intercept are calculated as the overall mean intercept estimate (`r coef(summary(model.rand.int))[\"(Intercept)\",\"Estimate\"]`) added to the estimated individual specific effects. The slope coefficient is taken just from the fixed effect estimate. This is in line with the fact that we fitted a random intercept model. From this output we can make individual level predictions for the individuals in our observed data, which doesn't have much meaning for individuals not in our study.\n",

    "In this plot each dashed grey line represents an individual, while the black solid line represents the overall mean effect. What we can see is that each line starts at a different height on the y axis courtesy of the individual specific intercepts. All the lines are parallel however. The slope of the line is determined by the slope coefficient for `VisitNum` and as this isn't dependent on the random variable there is no variation across individuals. Hence all the lines changes at the same rate. The solid black line falls approximately in the middle, with approximately half on the individual specific lines above and below. This is due to the mean do the distribution of the individual effects being set to 0. The black line tells us about the average individual, and is what we would use to make predictions about an individual outside of this cohort and describe the effect.\n",

    "## Assumptions for random intercept model\n",
    "\n",
    "As with all statistical tests, the ability to calculate estimates of the parameters and perform significance testing relies of assumptions about the data you are using. For a random intercepts model these are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Linear relationship between predictors and outcomes.\n",
    "-   Constant variance across range of predictor variables (homoscedasticity).\n",
    "-   Errors at every level are normally distributed.\n",
    "-   The level 1 and level 2 residuals are uncorrelated.\n",
    "-   The errors at the highest level are uncorrelated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diagnostic plots\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no automatic way to produce the diagnostic plots like you can from the linear regression function (`lm()`). However we can recreate these plots by extracting the required statistics from the `lmer` model object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we can plot the residuals against the fitted values. In this plot we want the points to be randomly scattered with no evidence of a relationship between the x and y axis. Any evidence of the residuals being related to the fitted values may be indicative of a non-linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. In this example they look pretty random with no obvious pattern.\n"

    "Secondly, we will consider the distribution of the residuals. Similar to linear regression, the residuals are assumed to be normally distributed with constant standard deviation. Therefore we can use a QQ plot to assess this (as well as look at the values provided in the summary of the model fit which should be symmetric and have a median \\~ 0). With a qq plot (or quantile-quantile plot), we are looking for the points to follow the diagonal line, any deviation indicates that the data are not normally distributed. In this example it looks pretty good."

It is essentially a caution applied to the result. This is different to an error, whereby the function is prematurely stopped due to some unexpected input or result. If you are executing some R code as a script, then a warning will not cause the script to stop, but an error will. We can see that despite the warning, the `lmer()` command has completed and produced an output by the fact that we are able to call `summary()` on the fitted lmer object. However, the fact that there was a warning, means we should treat this result with some caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output from the random slopes model is very similar to that from the random intercepts model. The difference is that under the `Random effects` section, there is an extra row for the random slope, and an extra column for the estimated covariance. We interpret and do hypothesis testing of the fixed effects as we did before. Again in this example, Visit Number is significantly positively correlated with the performance in cognitive test A. More than that the values of fixed effect coefficients are very similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at the estimated parameters for the random effects provided in the summary output we can see that the estimated variance for the random intercepts is `r signif(as.data.frame(VarCorr(model.rand.slope))[1,4],3)` and the variance for the random slopes is `r signif(as.data.frame(VarCorr(model.rand.slope))[2,4],3)`. While the magnitude of these is quite dramatically different, their values are relative to the values of the coefficients. We can also see that the correlation between an individual's random intercept and random slope is `r signif(as.data.frame(VarCorr(model.rand.slope))[3,\"sdcor\"],3)`, indicating that individuals with larger intercepts have smaller slopes. In other words, individuals who have higher baseline cognitive scores, have smaller changes in cognition across the course of the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "To formally test whether the random slopes for `VisitNum` improve the fit of the model we can use the likelihood ratio test through the `anova()` function. Specifically we want to compare our random slopes model with the random intercepts model which we fitted earlier. Hence we can just run the command\n"

    "In this plot each dashed grey line represents an individual, while the black solid line represents the overall mean effect. What we can see is that each line starts at a different height on the y axis curtesy of the individual specific intercepts. As we saw from the coefficients, each individual has a different slope coefficient, so they are no longer parallel, howevere, that is not obvious to the human eye in this picture. In fact they are only very subtly different, and our significance testing informed us that there was at worst very little variance across individuals. So it is not surprising that we can't see how this manifests in the data. The black line tells us about the average individual, and is what we would use to make predictions about an individual outside of this cohort and describe the effect.\n",

    "As with the random intercepts model these look pretty reasonable and no reason to believe the model is biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some notes on model formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we start incorporating random slopes the interpretation of some predictor variables can get quite complicated. Some things to consider when deciding what model to fit:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If we have a random slope, we don't need to have a random intercept.\n",
    "-   We can have random slopes for continuous, categorical, non-linear or interaction predictor variables.\\\n",
    "-   Where we have multiple predictor variables, we don't have to have random slopes for all the predictor variables - we can be selective in which relationships we think group level effects are relevant for.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fixed effects vs random effects\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have a categorical variable sometimes it can be hard to decide if it should be modeled as a fixed or random effect? This is arguably a subjective decision at times but a few things to consider are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   How many groups?\n",
    "    -   Lots of groups would add lots of variables, so maybe more efficient to estimate variance across effects\n",
    "-   Do categories have particular meaning?\n",
    "    -   Can we reassign the ids and not affect the interpretation, if yes a random effect.\n",
    "-   Do we predict differences (potentially interesting) between the categories?\n",
    "    -   If yes, fixed effect\n",
    "\n",
    "Random effects can be thought of as\n",
    "\n",
    "-   nuisance parameters - we need to model them but we don't care about them (e.g. some artefact of data collection)\n",
    "\n",
    "OR\n",
    "\n",
    "-   they may be of particular interest\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, sample size is a bigger issue for mixed effects models compared to standard regression models, as data feature multiple levels. The level-2 sample size (i.e. number of groups) is the most important factor for determining whether the model will be afflicted by small sample issues."
