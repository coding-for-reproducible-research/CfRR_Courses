    "## Scenario: A miracle arthritis inflammation cure\n",
    "\n",
    "Our imaginary colleague “Dr. Maverick” has invented a new miracle drug that promises to cure arthritis inflammation flare-ups after only 3 weeks since initially taking the medication! Naturally, we wish to see the clinical trial data, and after months of asking for the data they have finally provided us with a CSV spreadsheet containing the clinical trial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CSV file contains the number of inflammation flare-ups per day for the 60 patients in the initial clinical trial, with the trial lasting 40 days. Each row corresponds to a patient, and each column corresponds to a day in the trial. Once a patient has their first inflammation flare-up they take the medication and wait a few weeks for it to take effect and reduce flare-ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how effective the treatment is we would like to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate the average inflammation per day across all patients.\n",
    "- Plot the result to discuss and share with colleagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "![3-step flowchart shows inflammation data records for patients moving to the Analysis step\n",

    "\n",
    "## Download the data\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to open JupyterLab, and create a new folder for our project. In this folder, lets create a new folder called data. We can then download some data from [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/data/python-novice-inflammation-data.zip).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unzip this folder, and move the `.csv` files into the same folder as your Jupyter notebook, or JupyterLab instance. This can be done by dragging them across onto the sidebar.\n"
