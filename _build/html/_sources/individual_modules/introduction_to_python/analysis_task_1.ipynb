    "The expression `data[30, 20]` accesses the element at row 30, column 20. While this expression may not surprise you, `data[0, 0]` might. Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB and R start counting at 1 because that's what human beings have done for thousands of years. Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0 because it represents an offset from the first value in the array (the second value is offset by one index from the first value). This is closer to the way that computers represent arrays (if you are interested in the historical reasons behind counting indices from zero, you can read [Mike Hoye's blog post](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/)).\n",

    "How did we know what functions NumPy has and how to use them? If you are working in IPython or in a Jupyter Notebook, there is an easy way to find out. If you type the name of something followed by a dot, then you can use tab completion (e.g. type `np.` and then press <kbd>Tab</kbd>) to see a list of all functions and attributes that you can use. After selecting one, you can also add a question mark (e.g. `np.cumprod?`), and IPython will return an explanation of the method! This is the same as doing `help(np.cumprod)`. Similarly, if you are using the \"plain vanilla\" Python interpreter, you can type `np.` and press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key twice for a listing of what is available. You can then use the `help()` function to see an explanation of the function you're interested in, for example: `help(np.cumprod)`.\n",
