    "# Accessibility Statement for CfRR Courses\n",
    "\n",
    "At **Coding for Reproducible Research (CfRR)**, we are committed to ensuring digital accessibility for all users, regardless of ability or technology. We are actively working to improve the accessibility and usability of our website and strive to make our content inclusive for the widest possible audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measures to Support Accessibility\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Follow the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) standards.\n",
    "- Use clear and simple language where possible.\n",
    "- Provide structured content using headings and lists.\n",
    "- Offer alternative text for images and visual elements.\n",
    "- Ensure sufficient color contrast for text and backgrounds.\n",
    "- Make our website navigable by keyboard and accessible to screen readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Accessible is this Website?\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that some parts of this website may not be fully accessible, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some older documents and embedded materials may not be fully compatible with assistive technologies.\n",
    "- Some visualisations and interactive elements may not have complete keyboard or screen reader support.\n",
    "- Downloadable files may not always be in accessible formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are working to address these issues and welcome feedback from users to help us prioritize improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reporting Accessibility Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, please contact us:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Email:** codingforreproducibleresearch@exeter.ac.uk\n",
    "- **Feedback Form:** https://coding-for-reproducible-research.github.io/CfRR_Courses/contributing/suggestions_form.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparation of this Accessibility Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement was prepared on [15th July 2025]. It was last reviewed on [15th July 2025].  \n",
    "This website is regularly tested for accessibility issues, and we aim to update this statement and our site as we improve.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Known Accessibility Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Tables Generated from R\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tables created within our R-based teaching materials use multiple header rows or columns but do not include `headers` attributes in `<td>` elements. This affects screen reader usability, particularly for complex tables. These are autogenerated from R output and are presented as-is to reflect authentic results and maintain consistency with the source language’s conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example page: [`data_types.html`](../individual_modules/introduction_to_r/data_types.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe altering these outputs post-generation would compromise the educational integrity of the material, and have decided to leave them as they are originally. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Teal-Coloured Julia Warning Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Some warning messages from the Julia programming language are displayed using a teal color that does not meet minimum contrast standards (WCAG 2.2 requires 4.5:1 for normal text). These warnings are auto-generated outputs when making use of `@code_warntype`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example page: [`performant_code.html`](../introduction_to_julia/performant_code.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have left these warnings in their original form to preserve the realism of the programming environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Missing `scope` Attribute on `<th>` Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain tables generated from statistical model outputs in R use `<th>` elements without including a `scope` attribute to indicate whether the header applies to a row or a column. This can impair the ability of screen readers to correctly associate headers with corresponding data cells, especially in summary or regression tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Affected pages:\n",
    "  - [`logistic_regression.html`](../regression_analysis_with_R/logistic_regression.html)\n",
    "  - [`regression_analysis_with_r_extras.html`](../regression_analysis_with_R/regression_analysis_with_r_extras.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "These outputs reflect the default rendering of R model summaries and have been retained to accurately represent R’s output format.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n"
