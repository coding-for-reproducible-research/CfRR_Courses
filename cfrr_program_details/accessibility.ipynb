    "# Accessibility Statement for CfRR Courses\n",
    "\n",
    "University of Exeter is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "This accessibility statement applies to the [Coding for Reproducible Research (CfRR) website](https://coding-for-reproducible-research.github.io/CfRR_Courses/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "To notify us of any accessibility compliance failures or to request information or content excluded from the scope of the Directive, please use one of the following methods:\n",
    "- **GitHub issue**: [Submit an issue](https://github.com/coding-for-reproducible-research/CfRR_Courses/issues/new)  \n",

    "## Non-Accessible Content\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Tables Generated from R\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tables created within our R-based teaching materials use multiple header rows or columns but do not include `headers` attributes in `<td>` elements. This affects screen reader usability, particularly for complex tables. These are autogenerated from R output and are presented as-is to reflect authentic results and maintain consistency with the source language’s conventions. We believe altering these outputs post-generation would compromise the educational integrity of the material, and have decided to leave them as they are originally. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Teal-Coloured Julia Warning Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Some warning messages from the Julia programming language are displayed using a teal color that does not meet minimum contrast standards (WCAG 2.2 requires 4.5:1 for normal text). These warnings are auto-generated outputs when making use of `@code_warntype`. We have left these warnings in their original form to preserve the realism of the programming environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Missing `scope` Attribute on `<th>` Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain tables generated from statistical model outputs in R use `<th>` elements without including a `scope` attribute to indicate whether the header applies to a row or a column. This can impair the ability of screen readers to correctly associate headers with corresponding data cells, especially in summary or regression tables. These outputs reflect the default rendering of R model summaries and have been retained to represent R’s output format accurately, and have so been left within the website for authenticity. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Auto-Generated Output with Insufficient Color Contrast\n",
    "\n",
    "Several pages contain output generated directly from R or Python packages, where the text color does not meet WCAG 2.2 contrast requirements. These outputs are left in their original form to maintain fidelity with the tools being taught and to avoid presenting altered or potentially misleading results. These instances are the result of direct console or library output from R and Python, and modifying them would be disingenuous to the pedagogical intent of teaching the tools in their real-world usage context.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "### Making RStudio more accessible\n",
    "\n",
    "Learners using RStudio may find the following resources helpful when configuring their environment for improved accessibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [RStudio Accessibility Overview](https://posit.co/accessibility/)\n",
    "* [RStudio Accessibility Features](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/accessibility/accessibility.html)\n",
    "* [RStudio Keyboard Shortcuts](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/)\n",
    "\n",
    "We encourage learners to explore these options prior to starting a course and to use settings that best support their individual needs. If you have any questions please reach out the CfRR team. \n",
