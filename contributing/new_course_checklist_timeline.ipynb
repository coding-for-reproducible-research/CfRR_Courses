    "## Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistics & Planning\n",
    "- [ ] Schedule and hold **initial logistics call** with Programme Management and Delivery Team  \n",
    "- [ ] Define roles: Developer, Leader, Helper, Participant, Programme Management  \n",
    "- [ ] Open GitHub Issue for the new course; create feature branch  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Content Creation & Structure\n",
    "- [ ] Draft **course objectives** and detailed **learning objectives** for each section of the course\n",
    "- [ ] Develop Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) for Python or learnr tutorials (`.Rmd`) for R. Other types of course should be discussed with the central CfRR team\n",
    "- [ ] Include slides or PDFs as needed; confirm static content links  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Metadata & Site Integration\n",
    "- [ ] Populate `programme_information` \n",
    "- [ ] Populate `section_landing_page`\n",
    "- [ ] Populate `where_is_my_understanding`\n",
    "- [ ] Ensure no overlap or missing sections  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Rendering & Functionality\n",
    "- [ ] Build with Jupyter Book on the PR; confirm notebooks render without errors  \n",
    "- [ ] Test interactive plots, embedded HTML, and widgets  \n",
    "- [ ] Validate “Where Is My Understanding?” quiz (`display_quiz(\"path/to/quiz.json\")`)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Asset Linking & URL Encoding\n",
    "- [ ] Verify all file paths (spaces, special characters) are realtive paths as used in JupyterBook\n",
    "- [ ] Confirm images, data files, and HTML assets load correctly  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessibility & Style\n",
    "- [ ] Use descriptive headings (H1–H3) and labels  \n",
    "- [ ] Provide concise alt text for all images  \n",
    "- [ ] Check colour contrast with a Contrast Checker  \n",
    "- [ ] Avoid conveying information by colour alone; add text indicators, change shapes of points etc  \n",
    "- [ ] Use clear, simple language and accessible tables  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing & QA\n",
    "- [ ] Execute all notebooks end-to-end  \n",
    "- [ ] Peer-review code comments and markdown explanations  \n",
    "- [ ] Conduct cross-browser and device checks  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Highlighting Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Auditing materials refreshes your understanding and helps improve accuracy. Types of issues include:  \n",
