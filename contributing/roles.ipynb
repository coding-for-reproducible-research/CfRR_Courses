    "Workshop helpers support the workshop leader and participants as required. They are there to ensure participants can engage fully with the workshop and to ease the workload of the workshop lead. Depending on the nature of the workshop, there mat be one or more helpers. We keep a record of contributions on our website, [here](../cfrr_program_details/courses_overview).\n",

    "\n",
    "### In advance of the workshop \n",
    "- Review the pre-existing course materials and notify programme management if there are any concerns with these.  \n",
    "- Review reports from previous deliveries of the same workshop. \n",
    "- Coordinate with the other members of the workshop delivery team and ensure that they are clear on their roles and know when and where to attend on the day. \n",
    "- This is often best achieved by attending a pre-workshop meeting of up to 30 minutes with the rest of the delivery team.  \n",
    "- Review the pre-course questionnaire information for participants to familiarise themselves with the current experience level and expectations of the participants. \n",

    "### In advance of the workshop \n",
    "- Review the pre-existing course materials and notify programme management if there are any concerns with these. The workshop lead is not expected to create course materials; this is handled by a different role. Similarly, the workshop lead should not revise the materials without first consulting the programme management. \n",
    "- Familiarise yourself with the learning objectives for the session and plan to deliver the workshop in a way that ensures these are met to the best of your ability. The priority is achieving the intent behind the objectives rather than covering every single piece of content or activity.\n",
    "- Review reports from previous deliveries of the same workshop. \n",
    "- Decide whether a troubleshooting session for installation queries will be held and liaise with programme management to communicate this to participants. \n",
    "- Coordinate with the other members of the workshop delivery team and ensure that they are clear on their roles and know when and where to attend on the day. \n",
    "- Attend a pre-workshop meeting of up to 30 minutes with the rest of the delivery team. Experienced workshop leads may be happy to organise and host this meeting. Otherwise, programme management can facilitate. \n",

    "    - Share the learning objectives of the workshop and the delivery method. \n",

    "    - Acknowledge the contribution of the Research Software & Analytics Team and community of researchers who deliver this training. \n",
    "    - Share the Code of Conduct and note that attendance is an agreement to adhere by this. \n",
    "- Deliver the course materials using a methodology appropriate to the learning objectives. For novices, this is predominately by live coding. \n",
    "- Be flexible with timing, by extending or shortening activities as needed to match the group’s pace and engagement.\n",
    "- Prioritise Quality Over Quantity: It is better to cover fewer topics and ensure participants achieve a meaningful understanding, rather than rushing to touch on everything. If the group is especially engaged with an exercise, allow more time and feel free to skip or condense other activities.\n",
    "- Monitor Participant Engagement: Actively observe the group’s energy and participation. Use breaks strategically and encourage open discussions, group work, or partner activities to foster engagement and peer learning.\n",
    "- Schedule regular breaks (one/two for a three-hour session). \n",
    "- Leave adequate time to wrap up the workshop: \n",

    "Workshop developers are responsible for creating, updating or maintaining the course materials used in workshops as determined by the Programme Management. This role is crucial for ensuring that the content is accurate, up-to-date, and meets the standard for the programme's overarching objectives. They may work independently or as part of a team. There is no expectation that those developing the materials will deliver the training. As CfRR is community-led, course materials will evolve over time with changes to content made by multiple individuals and arising as part of an ongoing discourse with the community. Suggestions, agreed actions and ongoing development work will be documented via GitHub as issues, branches, commits and pull requests. As a workshop developer you will become familiar with these tools and the CfRR community can support you in this regard.  \n",

    "- Adhere to standardised software choices for delivery of specific languages and topics. For example this includes using Anaconda and JupyterLab to teach Introductory Python, RStudio to teach Introductory to R and learnr for R workshops that extend beyond beginners.  \n",
    "- Ensure the materials are clear, concise, and pedagogically sound, catering to the diverse experience levels of participants and appropriate for both in person and online delivery. \n",
    "- Ensure that all materials are accessible and easily distributed to participants.
