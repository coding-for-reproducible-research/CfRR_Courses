    "# Working With Data in R\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Description \n",
    "\n",
    "Over two sessions, learn how to use the Tidyverse to work with data in R. The Tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed to help you manipulate, clean and analyse data. This course will introduce you to the functionality of several key packages, while also discussing some of the conventions the Tidyverse uses when working with data. By the end of the course, participants should feel confident to continue using the Tidyverse to work with datasets in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Objectives \n",
    "On completion of this series of workshops, participants will:\n",
    "- Be able to explain what is meant by the ‘tidy’ format (a widely recognised convention for structuring data).\n",
    "- Know how to read tabular data from a file to a dataframe.\n",
    "- Be able to manipulate datasets, including creating new variables, filtering data, summarising and sorting data.\n",
    "- Know how to join multiple datasets together and reshape data.\n",
    "- Learn how to work with strings and dates (as time permits).\n",
    "- Gain hands on experience working with R notebooks for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisite Knowledge \n",
    "This course is for participants who already have some programming experience with R. It assumes familiarity with things like: creating and setting variables, the basic data structures (dataframes, vectors, lists), using functions, running R code and viewing console output, installing R packages and using R packages in your own code. Experience with R notebooks is not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation Guide \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to fully participate in this course, you should bring a laptop to work\n",
    "on during the sessions and make sure you have the following installed on it\n",
    "**before** the first session.\n",
    "\n",
    "- R, version 4.1 or later. You can install this from the University's\n",
    "  Company Portal software repository. Alternatively, visit\n",
    "  <a href=\"https://cran.rstudio.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noreferrer\">https://cran.rstudio.com</a>,\n",
    "  or adopt whatever method you usually use.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- RStudio desktop. You can download this from the University's\n",
    "  Company Portal software repository. Alternatively, visit\n",
    "  <a href=\"https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noreferrer\">https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/</a>.\n",
    "  We will use RStudio to work with R notebooks throughout the course. If you have\n",
    "  another way of working with R notebooks that you prefer, then you are welcome\n",
    "  to use this, but we recommend using RStudio if you're unsure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure you have following R packages installed:\n",
    "  - `tidyverse`\n",
    "  - `palmerpenguins` (This contains a dataset we'll use in examples during the\n",
    "    course.)\n",
    "  - `readxl`\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will also need to **download the course materials** (select\n",
    "whichever archive format works best for you):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Zip archive: [Download Course Materials](course_materials/course_materials.zip)\n",
    "- Tar gzip archive: [Download Course Materials](course_materials/course_materials.tar.gz)\n",
    "\n",
    "These contain R notebooks and datasets that will be worked through in the course\n",
    "sessions. The notebooks are designed to work with the relative directory\n",
    "structure in the archives, so it's best not to change this structure! We suggest\n",
    "you place the archive in a directory specifically for this course and then\n",
    "unpack the contents within this directory. You will also find an R project file\n",
    "`Working_with_data_in_R.Rproj`: double-clicking on this should open RStudio at\n",
    "the correct directory containing all the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
