    "# Regression Analysis with R\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Description \n",
    "\n",
    "Regression analysis is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between multiple variables. It is a very flexible tool that can handle a range of different data types (continuous, binary or categorical) and address both complex and simple research questions. In this hands on workshop you will learn how to fit a range of regression models with R, how to interpret the output and the link between regression and other common statistical tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Objectives\n",
    "- Understand the types of questions regression can be used to answer.\n",
    "- Be able to fit a linear regression model with multiple predictor variables.\n",
    "- Be able to fit logistic regression model with multiple predictor variables.\n",
    "- Be able to extract and summarise the results from a range of regression models.\n",
    "- Be able to design a regression model appropriate for addressing their specific research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisite Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "Learners are expected to already be familiar with the basics of R, such as how to load a dataset from a local file and manipulate variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation Guide \n",
    "\n",
    "As this course extends upon Introduction to R, the installation instructions for the base R elements are the same, available [here](intro_to_r.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside having R itself, you will need some additional packages: \n",
    "Install necessary R packages\n",
    "Three packages are needed for this workshop. The first two (devtools & learnr) are available from CRAN. The third is a package we have developed with the course materials and is available from GitHub (cfrrRTutorials).\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will install these three packages.\n",
    "```\n",
    "install.packages(\"devtools\") \n",
    "install.packages(\"learnr\") \n",
    "library(devtools)\n",
    "devtools::install_github(\"ejh243/cfrr-r-tutorials\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you encounter any difficulties with installation, please reach out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Self Study Material Link \n",
    "\n",
    "The self-study material for this course is available [here](../individual_modules/section_landing_pages/regression_analysis_with_R.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Developers\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop was developed by Eilis Hannon.\n",
