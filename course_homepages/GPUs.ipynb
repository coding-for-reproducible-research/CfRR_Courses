    "This course provides all the essential tools to leverage GPUs effectively, guiding participants through GPU programming, software management, and performance optimisation while offering direct comparisons with CPU implementations. Through hands-on examples such as Conwayâ€™s Game of Life and temperature diffusion, learners explore practical high-performance computing techniques, including profiling, Slurm job scheduling, and Spack-based environment setup. The material bridges theory and practice, equipping participants to translate computational concepts into efficient, scalable workflows on modern HPC systems."
