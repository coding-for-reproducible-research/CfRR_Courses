# Overview

This page is for sharing useful resources that don’t fit neatly into an existing CfRR course yet (for example: external short courses, excellent references, or recommended tools).

To add a resource, please open a Pull Request (PR) editing this [file](https://github.com/coding-for-reproducible-research/CfRR_Courses/blob/main/resources/resources.md). For contribution guidance, including the process of opening a PR please see the **Join Us!** section of the website, particularly the [contribution guidance](../contributing/contributing.ipynb). 

## A–Z

Please add new items under the relevant letter so this page stays easy to scan.

### A

### C

- [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) — Teaching foundational coding and data science skills to researchers.
- [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/) — Training workshops and resources for better research software development.

#### C and C++

- **Core references**
  - [C reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c)
  - [C++ reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
- **Tooling**
  - [Compilers: GCC docs](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/) and [Clang docs](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/)

### D

- [DES RAP Book](https://pythonhealthdatascience.github.io/des_rap_book/) - step‑by‑step open book on building discrete‑event simulation (DES) models in Python and R as part of a reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP), with worked healthcare examples and template repositories. Although centred on DES as an example, there is lots of guidance that is broadly relevant (e.g., environments, version control, structuring research as a package, documentation, linting, github actions, code review, licensing, citation, sharing and archiving).
