## Mission Statement 
Coding for Reproducible Research (CfRR) actively supports the delivery of the universityâ€™s Strategy 2030 commitment to research excellence through an open, ethical and supportive research culture while ensuring its community is well-equipped to capitalize on the opportunities presented by technology, big data and artificial intelligence. 

It offers an annual series of workshops for all registered staff and students, supporting colleagues in developing their digital skills and enabling them to confidently progress technical aspects of their work, such as data processing and interrogation, in an efficient and reproducible manner. 

CfRR offers hands-on courses, supplemented by freely available self-study materials, on programming and data science, including guidance on good practice and reproducibility, providing opportunities for novices through to experts to further their skills.
