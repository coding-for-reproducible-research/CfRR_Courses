    "# Unit testing in R with `testthat`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand why automated testing is valuable.\n",
    "- Learn how to use the `testthat` package to write tests for functions in R.\n",
    "- Learn a standard practice for organising your functions and tests.\n",
    "- Gain some tips and advice for writing tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people test their code in a manual, ad-hoc fashion. In R, this might typically be in the form of sourcing particular lines in a script, or trying out a function in the console with one or two different inputs and checking by eye that it gives the right answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is fine up to a point, there is a lot of value in turning testing into an automated process, that is, writing code that runs tests for us. There are several reasons why automated tests are valuable:\n",
    "- **It leads to fewer bugs.** When we test we often take a more critical view of our code and start to consider all the 'unexpected' cases where it could go wrong. This helps us identify potential bugs before they become a problem, making our code more robust.\n",
    "- **They provide a safety net for us when making changes to code.** Have you ever encountered a situation when you changed some bit of code, but then this lead to an error elsewhere in the code which you didn't foresee? Having a suite of automated tests that we can run whenever we make changes to code gives us confidence that our change didn't unexpectely cause incorrect behaviour in another part of the code. This is especially valuable when we're coming back to code after time away and have forgotten the details of how it works, or if we're working on someone else's code: having a suite of tests gives us much more confidence to make changes without fear of unexpected bugs creeping in.\n",
    "- **It nearly always improves the design of our code.** Writing tests for our code encourages us to structure it in such a way that it is easy to test, which often means breaking it down into simpler pieces (functions) that pass data between each other: this is often easier to understand and modify. Furthermore, writing tests forces us to really think about _what exactly the code needs to do_, in a range of scenarios. The act of writing tests is a great tool for bringing clarity to our thinking.\n",
    "- **It gives others confidence in our code.** Having a suite of tests demonstrates that we've taken the time to check it works correctly and provides a precise record of what has been tested (and what might not have been tested).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will guide you through writing unit tests in R, using the [`testthat` package](https://testthat.r-lib.org/). Unit testing, for the purposes of this tutorial, means testing functions that we've written ourselves, to check that they behave correctly on different inputs. This tutorial therefore assumes that you have some experience with writing functions in R and using these in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install `testthat` from CRAN in the usual way, using `install.package` or `renv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "install.packages(\"testthat\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Or if using renv for package management:\n",
    "renv::install(\"testthat\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on `testthat` before we begin\n",
    "\n",
    "The `testthat` package is designed mainly for writing tests for functions that are in an R package. The [R Packages book by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan](https://r-pkgs.org/) (2nd ed at time of writing) provides an excellent handbook for creating your own R packages, including the use of `testthat` for writing tests for the package. This tutorial presents a simplified and somewhat unorthodox use of `testthat` that doesn't require your code to be in a package. However, in the long term you may want to consider putting your functions into a package to use `testthat` 'properly' (besides this, it's a great way of sharing your functions with others)."

    "## Setting up your test files\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally we keep our tests in separate files to our main R source files. The recommended practice is to have the following structure in our project:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "MyAnalysis/\n",
    "├── R/\n",
    "│   ├── data_cleaning.R\n",
    "│   ├── data_loading.R\n",
    "│   └── utilities.R\n",
    "├── ... <other files and folders>\n",
    "└── tests/\n",
    "    └── testthat/\n",
    "        ├── test_data_cleaning.R\n",
    "        ├── test_data_loading.R\n",
    "        └── test_utilities.R\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All files of functions are kept in a folder called `R`. This is a standard pattern with R codebases, particularly with R packages. We suggest you keep to this pattern.\n",
    "- All files containing tests **must** begin with either `test_` or `test-`, because `testthat` assumes this naming convention when looking for tests to run.\n",
    "- It is very common practice to have one test file per file of functions, with the test file name derived from the file it corresponds to. This keeps the tests organised and easy to navigate. Only deviate from this convention if you have a compelling reason to.\n",
    "- It's not strictly necessary to keep the tests in a subfolder `testthat` of `tests`. But we recommend this because (1) it's the layout that `testthat` is designed to work with; (2) it is the layout required by `testthat` if you later decide to turn your project into an R package; and (3) it is the layout other developers familiar testing using `testthat` will expect, so is easier for them to follow."

This function is an example of what `testthat` refers to as _expectations_: these are just functions that are used by `testthat` to check whether some condition is `TRUE`/`FALSE` or that some other thing happened (such as an error being raised, for example). We'll see a few more expectations later.\n",

    "\n",
    "When we test a function, we are basically putting it under scrutiny: we try to think about ways it could go wrong and check that it behaves correctly. Often this includes considering cases we might not have thought about when we wrote the original function: for example, what if `NULL` or `NA` gets supplied as the value of one of the arguments? Or what if a function that takes in a vector receives a vector of length zero? Or what if there are no rows left after doing some filtering of a dataframe?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keep the tests passing!\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully this one is obvious: Always ensure that **all** your tests pass. If a test starts to fail, then investigate why — don't just ignore it! If it shows that there is a bug in your code, then fix it. If on the other hand the test needs updating to be correct, then change it. Or, if the test is no longer relevant, then delete it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Re-run all the tests whenever you change your code\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of having a suite of unit tests is to catch bugs that might have unexpectedly crept into our code after we make a change. Therefore, run your tests whenever you make changes to your functions that are under test. We want to stress two points here:\n",
    "- You should run **all** of your tests, not just the ones for the function(s) you have changed. This is to ensure that your changes haven't adversely affected any other functions that rely on the modified functions. In practice, using `testthat::test_dir` means it's no harder to run all your tests than just a few of them.\n",
    "- Don't make a big change to your functions all in one go without running your tests. Instead, break down big changes into smaller steps and run the tests after each of the smaller steps. If at any point a test fails after a change, having made smaller changes will help you identify the cause of the failure much more quickly than a whole lot of changes. For the same reason, where possible we recommended only changing one function at a time between running tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keep tests organised\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already discussed how the usual convention is to have one test file for each R source file. In addition to this, keep all the tests within a test file grouped together by function, as this makes it easier to navigate and find your tests. Also make it clear in the description argument of `test_that` which function is being tested, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "test_that(\"my_func does such-and-such a thing\", {...})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Isolated tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Strive to ensure that each `test_that` test can be run completely on its own and that all the tests in your test files can be run in any order: don't assume that `testthat` will run the tests in a particular order. In particular, modifying global variables that are shared between tests is a very bad idea, because executing one test affects the setup conditions for the other tests in this case (which is a very tricky source of bugs). It's OK to repeat code / data between tests, because this keeps them independent. If you really need to use the same object between tests, look into [using test fixtures](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-advanced.html#test-fixtures) instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test behaviour, not implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, functions are like little machines that take input (through the arguments) and then return some value as the output and/or have some other side effect (like printing a message to the console or writing a file). Focus on testing the **behaviour** of functions and not how they're implemented. Put another way, how could you test that this machine is working correctly without peering into its internal mechanics? This approach is often called **black-box testing**: we test the function based just on its 'interface' (the inputs, outputs and any side effects). The advantage of this approach is that it allows us to change the internal workings of the function without affecting the tests. Another way to think about this: write your tests as if they were little snippets of example code showing a user of the function what it does and how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How much testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get into testing, it can sometimes be difficult to know where to stop and when you've done 'enough'. It's difficult to give a hard-and-fast rule about this because it's context specific. But you might find it helpful to think in terms of taking a risk-based approach. In general, the risk of an event is defined as the multiple of (1) the impact of of the event occuring, and (2) the likelihood of it occuring. So consider focussing on cases where the consequences of incorrect behaviour are significant (such as an incorrect calculation silently carrying through the analysis) or which are likely to occur (e.g. testing a function that cleans data that is very likely to contain missing values). Pay particular attention to the cases which are high risk i.e. likely to occur **and** that have a significantly negative impact if the code is wrong! On the other hand, if something is unlikely to happen and the consequences of incorrect code are minor then maybe it's not worth worrying about testing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keep tests simple\n",
    "\n",
    "Strive to keep tests simple. Sometimes we find that to test a particular behaviour of a function, we need to do quite a lot of set-up code or it's difficult to 'detect' the thing we're trying to check. In that case, consider whether you could break up the function into smaller parts that can be tested independently, or whether maybe that function is not quite the 'right' function and rewriting it would make it easier to test. Often, allowing the tests to inform the design of your functions in this way leads to code which is easier to change and understand, because it is broken down into pieces that can be changed / replaced with minimal impact on other parts of the code. Aside from this, keeping tests simple means we are less likely to make mistakes when writing the tests themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bug --> test\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you discover a bug in your code, before fixing your code write a test that detects that bug (i.e. fails initially but will pass when the code is corrected). This is a great way of building up a suite of tests and ensuring that bugs don't re-emerge in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools for testing more challenging things\n",
    "\n",
    "Occasionally you might need to write a test that involves making a change outside the test itself, like writing a file or updating some global setting. In this case, we need to ensure that the state of the system is returned to how it was before the test was run — not doing so can lead to situations where tests start incorrectly failing for unapparent reasons. The `testthat` package provides **test fixtures** for situations like these: see this [vignette on test fixtures](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/test-fixtures.html) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also mention here that the `testthat` package provides something called **snapshots** to help writing tests where the expected output is difficult to create manually, where we mostly just want to check that the output is 'the same' each time we run the test. This can be particularly helpful e.g. for checking that an image file of a graph hasn't changed. See this [vignette on snapshot tests](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/snapshotting.html) for details."
