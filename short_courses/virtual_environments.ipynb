    "# Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Objectives\n",
    "- **Explain the role of virtual environments**  \n",
    "  Understand why virtual environments are essential in Python development and how they help manage project dependencies and avoid conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create and activate a virtual environment with `venv`**  \n",
    "  Learn how to set up and use virtual environments using the built-in Python `venv` module on both macOS and Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Highlight different virtual environment tools**  \n",
    "  Identify the differences and advantages of `venv`, `Conda`, `Pipenv`, and `Poetry` for Python environment and dependency management.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "A **virtual environment** is an isolated workspace for your projects. The focus on this short course will be Python virtual environments, however the concept exists beyond just Python. It keeps all your project’s dependencies (libraries, packages, etc.) separate from other projects and from your system-wide installations. This isolation ensures that installing or updating a dependency in one project does not affect other projects or your system Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Virtual Environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dependency Management**  \n",
    "   Different projects might require different versions of the same library. A virtual environment allows each project to maintain its own set of dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reproducibility**  \n",
    "   Sharing code is easier when collaborators can recreate the exact environment you used, avoiding the “it works on my machine” problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conflict Avoidance**  \n",
    "   If one project needs `libraryX==1.2.0` and another needs `libraryX==2.0.0`, separate virtual environments prevent these requirements from clashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **System Integrity**  \n",
    "   Installing or updating packages system-wide can break other applications. Virtual environments confine these changes to the environment, leaving system Python untouched.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using venv across different operating systems \n",
    "\n",
    "Creating an exhaustive list of all of the different environments and package managers across all the different operating systems would be far too extensive to include as a short course here. As such, the two most common operating systems in use today, MacOS and Windows, are included here with the manager that is bundled with Python already, venv allowing you to get started with one manager on your operating system and explore other managers in your own time via the tutorials linked within this course. All of the managers' websites will highlight the pros of the manager that they are proposing, so the manager you should use will depend on your personal preference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that between the different operating system sections, there is some repetition of content to ensure that each of the different sections is able to be studied as stand-alone sections. \n",
    "\n",
    "### MacOS \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Opening the Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step on macOS to create a virtual environment is to open the 'Terminal'. This can be done by searching for the program and clicking on the program icon, which is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} figures/virtual_environments/terminal_icon.png\n",
    ":alt: An image of the macOS Terminal Icon\n",
    ":width: 300px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should then open a window such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} figures/virtual_environments/macos_terminal.png\n",
    ":alt: An image of the macOS Terminal\n",
    ":width: 1000px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verifying Python Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "You can verify that Python is installed correctly by running: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "depending on the version of python that you have installed, Python 2 or 3. When running the relevant above command it will take you to an interactive Python session, where you can define variables and print them such as with the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 3 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If when running these commands you produce the following output: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then you have confirmed that you have a working version of Python installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can exit the interactive session with the following command: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "exit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have Python installed currently, then you are able to install it via the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checking what is currently installed\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check which packages are currently installed with either of the following commands, again depending on if you have Python 2 or 3 installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip list \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip3 list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating an environment \n",
    "\n",
    "An environment can be created with the following command: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 -m venv virtual_environment_1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On macOS this can then be activated with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source virtual_environment_1/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your command line should now have a hint that highlights which environment you are currently in. This is key as it will make it easy at a glance to understand which environment you are in. Your command line should now look something like: \n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} figures/virtual_environments/venv_terminal_hint.png\n",
    ":alt: An image of the macOS Terminal with venv environment hint\n",
    ":width: 1000px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now deactivate the environment with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which will remove the environment hint from the command line, highlighting that you are no longer in any environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "You would now be able to create a second virtual environment, called `virtual_environment_2` with the following commands: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 -m venv virtual_environment_2\n",
    "source virtual_environment_2/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and easily switch between the two of them by first using `deactivate` and then `source <environment_name>/bin/activate`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing a package\n",
    "\n",
    "When we go to install a package it can be a good idea to check which packages are already installed which can be done with either of the following command depending on your python version: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip list \n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip3 list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should give you a list of different python packages that are current installed. If you wanted to install [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), a very widespread Python Data Analysis Library then you could run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip3 install pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "or \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when you check which packages are install using `pip list` you should see that pandas is installed and can be used within this environment in your python scripts with the use of `import pandas` in this case. If you were to now run `deactivate` and `pip list` again you would see that the pandas packages is not listed. This is the key goal of virtual environments, allowing you to easily swap between environments where different combinations, and even version of packages are installed. For example it might be the case that on one of your projects you need to use Package X, but that only works with Package Y Version 1. However, there is a new release of Package Y Version 2 that has some novel features that you are interested in using for another project. Virtual environments allow you to install these package combinations once in different environments and then quickly switch between them using the process described above without having to perform the time-intensive install and uninstall process each time you switch between working on the projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Openign the Command Prompt (CMD) or PowerShell \n",
    "\n",
    "On windows, you can open the **Command Prompt** by:\n",
    "1. Clicking on the **Start** menu (Windows icon).\n",
    "2. Typing **cmd** or **Command Prompt**\n",
    "3. Clicking on the **Command Prompt** icon.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} figures/virtual_environments/Command_Prompt.png\n",
    ":alt: An image of the Windows Command Prompt Icon\n",
    ":width: 500px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you may use **PowerShell** by typing **PowerShell** in the Start menu and selecting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} figures/virtual_environments/Powershell.png\n",
    ":alt: An image of the Windows PowerShell Icon\n",
    ":width: 500px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Command Prompt is opened, you will see a window such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} figures/virtual_environments/Command_Prompt_Terminal.png\n",
    ":alt: An image of the Windows Command Prompt Icon\n",
    ":width: 1000px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or if you are using PowerShell then you will see:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} figures/virtual_environments/Powershell_terminal.png\n",
    ":alt: An image of the Windows PowerShell Terminal\n",
    ":width: 1000px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verifying Python Installation \n",
    "\n",
    "In your Command Prompt or PowerShell, run \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes on Windows, Python might also be accessed with:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "py\n",
    "```\n",
    "and depending on the version of python installed, it might be accessed via \n",
    "```shell\n",
    "python3\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once you have determined under which name your Python installation is under you can continue to make use of that name for the rest of the steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can then verify that your Python installation is working properly by running: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 3 \n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the output produced is `3`, then you have installed Python correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are able to exit the interactive session by typing: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "exit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checking Which Packages Are Currently Installed \n",
    "\n",
    "You can check which packages are currently installed by running: \n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have multiple Python versions installed, you may need `pip3 list` or `py -m pip list`, depending on the particulars of your Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a Virtual Environment \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new virtual environment named `virtual_environment_1`, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "python -m venv virtual_environment_1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If `python` does not work, then you may need to try replacing it with either `py` or `python3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a folder called `virtual_environment_1` in your current directory. To activate this environment on Windows, use the `Scripts\\activate` script. For instance, if you are in the same directory where you created the folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    ".\\virtual_environment_1\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Note: In PowerShell, you might need to prepend `.\\` to the command.\n",
    "Example: `.\\virtual_environment_1\\Scripts\\activate.`\n",
    "\n",
    "After activation, your command line prompt will then change to indicate the environment name in parentheses, for example \n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "(virtual_environment_1) C:\\Users\\You>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps you see at a glance what environment you are using. \n",
    "\n",
    "To deactivate this environment, simply type:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your command line will now revert to its normal state, indicating you are no longer in a virtual environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating Multiple Environments \n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a second virtual environment, `virtual_environment_2`, as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "python -m venv virtual_environment_2\n",
    ".\\virtual_environment_2\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With it possible to easily switch between then by deactivating one and activating another:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    ".\\virtual_environment_1\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Installing a Package \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are inside an activated environment, you can install packages with `pip` (or `pip3` if that is what your system uses in a similar manner as before with `python`, `py` and `python3`). For example, to install [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/):\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when running \n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip list\n",
    "```\n",
    "you should see pandas listed among your installed packages. This means you can use `import pandas` with Python scripts in this environment. If you leave the environment by typing `deactivate` and then check `pip list` again (outside the environment), you will not see pandas listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior is the main advantage of virtual environments: they let you maintain different sets (and versions) of Python libraries for different projects, all on the same machine, without interference. For instance, you might need Package X that only works with Package Y version 1 for one project, while another project needs the newer Package Y version 2. With virtual environments, you can install each combination of packages only once and quickly switch between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Environment and Dependency Management Tools \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of different options available for environmental and dependency management tools. Below are some of the most widely used tools for this task within Python. The following sections act as a set of signposts to the more comprehensive guides to their use on their official websites. \n",

    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python -m venv .venv\n",
    "\n",
    "source .venv/bin/activate\n",

    "source env_name/bin/activate\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To install packages into the environment, a great method is to store all dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` (rather than directly installing them with `pip install package_name`). This is because you can save and share this file alongside your repository, and it allows others to easily see and make a copy of the environment you used for your analysis - and for yourself to reproduce that environment, when you return to your code years later!\n",

    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To update your environment (such as if you to have add a new package to the requirements file):\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To delete your environment, use the command below - but be careful! Do not name your environment with the same name as a folder in your current location. If so, you could accidentally permanently delete that folder rather than your environment...\n",
