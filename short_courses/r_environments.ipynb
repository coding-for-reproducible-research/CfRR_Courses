    "**Adapted from:** [**DES RAP Book: Reproducible Discrete-Event Simulation in Python and R**](https://pythonhealthdatascience.github.io/des_rap_book/) (Heather et al., 2025). This is a free online book which explains how to develop reproducible simulation studies as part of a reproducible analytical pipeline, using practical examples and open-source code. While it focuses on discrete-event simulation, many of its principles and techniques apply broadly across different types of projects. It was developed as part of the project STARS: Sharing Tools and Artefacts for Reproducible Simulations. It is supported by the Medical Research Council [grant number MR/Z503915/1].\n",

    "1. 🌎 **Environments:** Understanding the role of R environments.\n",
    "2. 📦 **Packages:** Dependency management using `renv`.\n",
    "3. 🔄 **R Version:** Switching between versions of R.\n",
    "4. ⚙️ **Other:** Managing other components of an R environment - namely, system libraries and project-specific settings.\n",

    "### What is an R environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "An R environment is the complete computational context required to run an R project. It includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **version of R** itself.\n",
    "* All **R packages** (and their versions) used in your analysis.\n",
    "* **System libraries** required by some R packages.\n",
    "* **Project-specific settings** (e.g., `.Rproj`, .`Rprofile`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are R environments important?\n",
    "\n",
    "* ⏳ **Reproducibility:** By recording the exact R version and package versions, you can recreate your analysis at any time, on any machine, and get the same results.\n",
    "* 🏝️ **Isolation:** Each project can have its own set of packages and R version, preventing conflicts between projects.\n",
    "* 🤝 **Collaboration:** Ensures that everyone working on the project uses the same setup.\n",

    "### Tools for dependency management\n",
    "\n",
    "The processing of tracking and controlling the packages your project uses, including their versions, is called **dependency management**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In R, the most popular tool for managing dependencies is [`renv`](https://github.com/rstudio/renv). This replaced and improved upon the previous tool, [`Packrat`](https://github.com/rstudio/packrat).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There is a new tool currently in development called [`rv`](https://github.com/A2-ai/rv) which aims to provide a more modern, declarative workflow. It requires all dependencies to be specified before installation (rather than taking snapshots as you go along like `renv`) and these dependencies are saved in an `rproject.toml` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating an `renv` environment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Install renv\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already, install `renv` from CRAN:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{.r}\n",
    "install.packages(\"renv\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding packages to the `renv` environment\n",

    "## ⚙️ Other\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the packages and R version used, your R environment will also include system libraries and project-specific settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most researchers handle these components by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Documenting required system libraries in the project's README or set-up instructions.\n",
    "* Including project files (like `.Rproj` and `.Rprofile`) in version control (e.g., Git).\n",
