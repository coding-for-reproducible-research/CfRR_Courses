    "### What is an R environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "An R environment is the complete computational context required to run an R project. It includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **version of R** itself.\n",
    "* All **R packages** (and their versions) used in your analysis.\n",
    "* **System libraries** required by some R packages.\n",
    "* **Project-specific settings** (e.g., `.Rproj`, .`Rprofile`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are R environments important?\n",
    "\n",
    "* ‚è≥ **Reproducibility:** By recording the exact R version and package versions, you can recreate your analysis at any time, on any machine, and get the same results.\n",
    "* üèùÔ∏è **Isolation:** Each project can have its own set of packages and R version, preventing conflicts between projects.\n",
    "* ü§ù **Collaboration:** Ensures that everyone working on the project uses the same setup.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Tools for dependency management\n",
    "\n",
    "The processing of tracking and controlling the packages your project uses, including their versions, is called **dependency management**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In R, the most popular tool for managing dependencies is [`renv`](https://github.com/rstudio/renv), which is covered in this course. `renv` replaced and improved upon the previous tool, [`Packrat`](https://github.com/rstudio/packrat).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There is a new tool currently in development called [`rv`](https://github.com/A2-ai/rv) which aims to provide a more modern, declarative workflow. It requires all dependencies to be specified before installation (rather than taking snapshots as you go along like `renv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating an `renv` environment\n",
    "\n",
    "````{dropdown} View steps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Install renv\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already, install `renv` from CRAN:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "install.packages(\"renv\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Create an R project\n",
    "\n",
    "It's best to use `renv` within an R project. R projects are commonly created and managed by RStudio.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RStudio, select \"File > New Project...\" and choose \"Existing Directory\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot from New Project Wizard: Create Project screen](figures/r_environments/rproject1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to your project directory, then select \"Create Project\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot from New Project Wizard: Create Project from Existing Directory screen](figures/r_environments/rproject2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create :\n",
    "\n",
    "* `.Rproj`: project file (contains some settings for the project).\n",
    "* `.Rproject.user/`: hidden folder with temporary project files (e.g. auto-saved source documents).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not using RStudio, R projects can be difficult to set-up, as they have to be created manually. It is possible to use `renv` *without* an R project though, as discussed in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/issues/460). This can be done using `setwd()` to set your repository as the current working directory, and then continuing with the steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Initialise `renv`\n",
    "\n",
    "In your R console, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "renv::init()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `renv/`: stores packages for the project.\n",
    "* `renv.lock`: records packages and the exact versions used.\n",
    "* `.Rprofile`: ensures `renv` activates when the project opens.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, `renv::init()` will scan your project directory to detect which packages are used. It will then install those packages into your project library. If your directory is empty or contains no code using packages, only `renv` itself will be installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to initialise `renv` without scanning for or installing any packages, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "renv::init(bare = TRUE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example `renv.lock` containing only `renv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"R\": {\n",
    "    \"Version\": \"4.4.1\",\n",
    "    \"Repositories\": [\n",
    "      {\n",
    "        \"Name\": \"CRAN\",\n",
    "        \"URL\": \"https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest\"\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"Packages\": {\n",
    "    \"renv\": {\n",
    "      \"Package\": \"renv\",\n",
    "      \"Version\": \"1.0.7\",\n",
    "      \"Source\": \"Repository\",\n",
    "      \"Repository\": \"CRAN\",\n",
    "      \"Requirements\": [\n",
    "        \"utils\"\n",
    "      ],\n",
    "      \"Hash\": \"397b7b2a265bc5a7a06852524dabae20\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With `renv` initialised, your project now has its own isolated library, separate from your global R packages and other projects. From here, you can install the packages relevant for your current project.\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding packages to the `renv` environment\n",
    "\n",
    "````{dropdown} View steps\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to simply install packages directly using commands like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "renv::install(\"packagename\")\n",
    "install.packages(\"packagename\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we recommend using a `DESCRIPTION` file. This is a file listing only the **main packages** your project directly depends on - i.e. those you might have add using `renv::install()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This differs from `renv.lock` which records **all packages** needed to recreate your environment, including every main package and all their dependencies, plus the exact versions used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of using a `DESCRIPTION` file when adding packages is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* üìù **Clear requirements.** The `DESCRIPTION` file gives a simple, readable summary of your project‚Äôs main packages. It‚Äôs much easier to read than `renv.lock`.\n",
    "* üì¶ **Consistency with package development**. If your project is (or might become) an R package, the `DESCRIPTION` file is the standard way to declare dependencies.\n",
    "* üîÑ **Alternative for environment recreation**. While `renv.lock` is the primary tool for restoring an `renv` environment, having a `DESCRIPTION` file is a valuable backup. If you encounter issues with `renv.lock`, you can use `DESCRIPTION` to reinstall the main dependencies.\n",
    "* üéØ **Explicit snapshots**. If you want precise control over what's included in `renv.lock`, you can use an \"explicit\" snapshot. This means only the packages listed in `DESCRIPTION` (and their dependencies) are recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Create a `DESCRIPTION` file\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a file named `DESCRIPTION` and use the following template (which can be generated instead using `usethis::use_description()`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Package: packagename\n",
    "Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)\n",
    "Version: 0.0.0.9000\n",
    "Authors@R: \n",
    "    person(\"First\", \"Last\", , \"first.last@example.com\", role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"))\n",
    "Description: What the package does (one paragraph).\n",
    "License: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to pick a\n",
    "    license\n",
    "Encoding: UTF-8\n",
    "Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)\n",
    "RoxygenNote: 7.0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. List dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependencies can be listed as `Imports` (required packages) or `Suggests` (optional/development packages). For non-package projects, it's simplest to list all dependencies under `Imports`, which will be identified by `renv` (whilst those under `Suggests` may not unless used in scripts). `Suggests` is more relevant when constructing a page, as it distinguishes packages necessary only for optional features, vignettes or testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** In the [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html) book, they recommend that versions are not specified in `DESCRIPTION`. Instead, they suggest that no version is specified - or that a minimum version is specified, if you know that an older version of specific package/s would break the code. This is why it is important to also create an `renv.lock` file (as below), so you do have a record of the exact versions used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Install packages from `DESCRIPTION`\n",
    "\n",
    "Install packages listed in `DESCRIPTION` (and their dependencies) with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "renv::install()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Update `renv.lock`\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a snapshot of your environment and update `renv.lock`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "renv::snapshot()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three snapshot types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Implicit** (default): Records packages in `DESCRIPTION` *and* those used in your code.\n",
    "* **Explicit**: Only records packages listed in `DESCRIPTION`.\n",
    "* **All**: Records all packages in your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using the default (implicit) to ensure all used packages are captured, even if not listed in `DESCRIPTION`. However, remove unused scripts to avoid capturing unnecessary packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "To check your current snapshot type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "renv::settings$snapshot.type()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To change it if needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "renv::settings$snapshot.type(\"implicit\")\n",
    "renv::settings$snapshot.type(\"explicit\")\n",

    "When recreating an R environmen‚Äîsuch as for an old project or when collaborating‚Äîyou have two main options, depending on the files available:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | What does it install? | Best for... |\n",
    "| - | - | - |\n",
    "| **From `renv.lock`** | Installs the exact package versions (and their dependencies) used previously | Full reproducibility; restoring the original environment exactly |\n",
    "| **From `DESCRIPTION`** | Installs the main packages listed (and their dependencies), but uses the latest available versions (unless specified) | Getting started quickly or if `renv.lock` is missing or problematic |\n",
    "\n",
    "If **neither file is available**, try to reconstruct a `DESCRIPTION` file based on your knowledge of the project's required packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Restoring from `renv.lock` (preferred)\n",
    "\n",
    "If `renv.lock` is present, use it to restore the packages originally used:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "renv::restore()\n",
    "```\n",

    "This reinstalls all packages at their recorded versions. Occasionally, issues may arise due to unavailable packages or system differences, especially for older projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rebuilding from `DESCRIPTION`\n",
    "\n",
    "If `renv.lock` is missing or problematic, use the `DESCRIPTION` file. This lists your main package dependencies, but usually not exact versions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "renv::install()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This installs the latest versions of listed packages and their dependencies. Results may differ from the original environment if packages have changed, since R does not guarantee full backward compatibility.\n",

    "Managing the R version is important for reproducibility, especially when your code relies on features or behaviors specific to a particular R release. There are different ways to handle R versions depending on your operating system - such as RSwitch or Homebrew on Mac, the CRAN installer on Windows, or manual installation and symbolic links on Linux. However, these methods can be inconsistent and sometimes complex.\n",
