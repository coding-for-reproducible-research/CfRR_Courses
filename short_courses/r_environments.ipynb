    "### What is an R environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "An R environment is the complete computational context required to run an R project. It includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **version of R** itself.\n",
    "* All **R packages** (and their versions) used in your analysis.\n",
    "* **System libraries** required by some R packages.\n",
    "* **Project-specific settings** (e.g., `.Rproj`, .`Rprofile`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are R environments important?\n",
    "\n",
    "* ‚è≥ **Reproducibility:** By recording the exact R version and package versions, you can recreate your analysis at any time, on any machine, and get the same results.\n",
    "* üèùÔ∏è **Isolation:** Each project can have its own set of packages and R version, preventing conflicts between projects.\n",
    "* ü§ù **Collaboration:** Ensures that everyone working on the project uses the same setup.\n",

    "For most users, the best way to manage R versions is to use [`rig`](https://github.com/r-lib/rig). It is a tool that allows you to easily install, list and switch between R versions on Windows, Mac and Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use `rig`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install `rig`\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the installation instructions for your operating system on the [rig GitHub page](https://github.com/r-lib/rig). After installation, check that it works by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "rig --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### View available R versions\n",
    "\n",
    "List all R versions installed on your machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "rig list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "* name   version  aliases\n",
    "------------------------------------------\n",
    "  3.6.0           \n",
    "  4.2.2           \n",
    "  4.3.1           \n",
    "  4.4.1           \n",
    "  4.5.0  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Add a new R version\n",
    "\n",
    "To install a specific R version:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "rig add 4.1.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or simply add the latest version:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "rig add\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set the active R version\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose which R version should be active (for example, when you open RStudio):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "rig default 4.1.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the selected version the default for new R sessions. (Note: If you later change versions manually or with other tools, you may need to reset this.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Legacy methods\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to know about older or alternative approaches, here are some legacy methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mac:** RSwitch, Homebrew\n",
    "* **Windows:** CRAN installer\n",
    "* **Linux:** Manual installation, symbolic links\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: These methods can be inconsistent and are generally more complex than rig.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Tools for dependency management\n",
    "\n",
    "The processing of tracking and controlling the packages your project uses, including their versions, is called **dependency management**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In R, the most popular tool for managing dependencies is [`renv`](https://github.com/rstudio/renv), which is covered in this course. `renv` replaced and improved upon the previous tool, [`Packrat`](https://github.com/rstudio/packrat).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There is a new tool currently in development called [`rv`](https://github.com/A2-ai/rv) which aims to provide a more modern, declarative workflow. It requires all dependencies to be specified before installation (rather than taking snapshots as you go along like `renv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating an `renv` environment\n",
    "\n",
    "`````{dropdown} View steps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Install renv\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already, install `renv` from CRAN:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "install.packages(\"renv\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Create an R project\n",
    "\n",
    "It's best to use `renv` within an R project. R projects are commonly created and managed by RStudio.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RStudio, select \"File > New Project...\" and choose \"Existing Directory\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot from New Project Wizard: Create Project screen](figures/r_environments/rproject1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to your project directory, then select \"Create Project\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot from New Project Wizard: Create Project from Existing Directory screen](figures/r_environments/rproject2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create :\n",
    "\n",
    "* `.Rproj`: project file (contains some settings for the project).\n",
    "* `.Rproject.user/`: hidden folder with temporary project files (e.g. auto-saved source documents).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not using RStudio, R projects can be difficult to set-up, as they have to be created manually. It is possible to use `renv` *without* an R project though, as discussed in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/issues/460). This can be done using `setwd()` to set your repository as the current working directory, and then continuing with the steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Initialise `renv`\n",
    "\n",
    "In your R console, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "renv::init()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `renv/`: stores packages for the project.\n",
    "* `renv.lock`: records packages and the exact versions used.\n",
    "* `.Rprofile`: ensures `renv` activates when the project opens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example `renv.lock` containing only `renv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"R\": {\n",
    "    \"Version\": \"4.4.1\",\n",
    "    \"Repositories\": [\n",
    "      {\n",
    "        \"Name\": \"CRAN\",\n",
    "        \"URL\": \"https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest\"\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"Packages\": {\n",
    "    \"renv\": {\n",
    "      \"Package\": \"renv\",\n",
    "      \"Version\": \"1.0.7\",\n",
    "      \"Source\": \"Repository\",\n",
    "      \"Repository\": \"CRAN\",\n",
    "      \"Requirements\": [\n",
    "        \"utils\"\n",
    "      ],\n",
    "      \"Hash\": \"397b7b2a265bc5a7a06852524dabae20\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you initialise `renv`, you project gets its own **project library** - a private folder (`renv/library/`) where packages are installed just for this project. This means package versions are isolated and recorded for each project, so updating a package in one project won't break others. This makes collaboration and reproducibility much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is different from the **user library**, which is the default shared location where R installs packages used by all your R projects. See the \"Packages\" section on RStudio, which will show your project v.s. user library:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot of RStudio within renv::init() in empty directory, creating project library alongside user library](figures/r_environments/renv_init.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some further information relevant when initialising `renv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "````{dropdown} Implicit or explicit mode\n",
    "\n",
    "If a `DESCRIPTION` file is present, `renv` will prompt you to choose how dependencies are discovered:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Implicit mode:** `renv` will scan you project files for any packages used in your code.\n",
    "* **Explicit mode:** `renv` will use only the packages listed in your `DESCRIPTION` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend choosing implicit mode for most projects, as it ensures that all packages actually used in your code are detected and managed, even if you forget to list them in `DESCRIPTION`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*We'll explain more about `DESCRIPTION` files and these modes in the section on adding packages to the environment.*\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "````{dropdown} Initialising a bare environment\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, `renv::init()` will scan and install packages into your project library. If your directory is empty or contains no code using packages, only `renv` itself will be installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to initialise `renv` without installing any packages, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "renv::init(bare = TRUE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create `renv/` and `.Rprofile` but not `renv.lock` or a project library.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when you later run `renv::snapshot()`, `renv` will scan and install packages at that point. If you use implicit mode, it will detect and install all packages used in your code - even if you started with a bare environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*We'll explain more about snapshots and implicit mode in the section on adding packages to the environment.*\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "`````\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding packages to the `renv` environment\n",
    "\n",
    "````{dropdown} View steps\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to simply install packages directly using commands like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "renv::install(\"packagename\")\n",
    "install.packages(\"packagename\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we recommend using a `DESCRIPTION` file. This is a file listing only the **main packages** your project directly depends on - i.e. those you might have add using `renv::install()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This differs from `renv.lock` which records **all packages** needed to recreate your environment, including every main package and all their dependencies, plus the exact versions used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of using a `DESCRIPTION` file when adding packages is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* üìù **Clear requirements.** The `DESCRIPTION` file gives a simple, readable summary of your project‚Äôs main packages. It‚Äôs much easier to read than `renv.lock`.\n",
    "* üì¶ **Consistency with package development**. If your project is (or might become) an R package, the `DESCRIPTION` file is the standard way to declare dependencies.\n",
    "* üîÑ **Alternative for environment recreation**. While `renv.lock` is the primary tool for restoring an `renv` environment, having a `DESCRIPTION` file is a valuable backup. If you encounter issues with `renv.lock`, you can use `DESCRIPTION` to reinstall the main dependencies.\n",
    "* üéØ **Explicit snapshots**. If you want precise control over what's included in `renv.lock`, you can use an \"explicit\" snapshot. This means only the packages listed in `DESCRIPTION` (and their dependencies) are recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Create a `DESCRIPTION` file\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a file named `DESCRIPTION` and use the following template (which can be generated instead using `usethis::use_description()`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Package: packagename\n",
    "Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)\n",
    "Version: 0.0.0.9000\n",
    "Authors@R: \n",
    "    person(\"First\", \"Last\", , \"first.last@example.com\", role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"))\n",
    "Description: What the package does (one paragraph).\n",
    "License: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to pick a\n",
    "    license\n",
    "Encoding: UTF-8\n",
    "Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)\n",
    "RoxygenNote: 7.0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. List dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependencies can be listed as `Imports` (required packages) or `Suggests` (optional/development packages).\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-package projects, it's simplest to list all dependencies under `Imports`, which will be identified by `renv` (whilst those under `Suggests` may not unless used in scripts).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Suggests` is more relevant when constructing a package, as it distinguishes packages necessary only for optional features, vignettes or testing, from those required within the package itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** In the [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html) book, they recommend that - in `DESCRIPTION` - no versions are specified, or a minimum version is specified if you know that an older version of specific package/s would break the code. This is why it is important to also create an `renv.lock` file (as below), so you do have a record of the exact versions used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Install packages from `DESCRIPTION`\n",
    "\n",
    "Install packages listed in `DESCRIPTION` (and their dependencies) with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "renv::install()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Update `renv.lock`\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a snapshot of your environment and update `renv.lock`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "renv::snapshot()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three snapshot types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Implicit** (default): Records packages in `DESCRIPTION` *and* those used in your code.\n",
    "* **Explicit**: Only records packages listed in `DESCRIPTION`.\n",
    "* **All**: Records all packages in your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using the default (implicit) to ensure all used packages are captured, even if not listed in `DESCRIPTION`. However, you should remove unused scripts to avoid capturing unnecessary packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "To check your current snapshot type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "renv::settings$snapshot.type()\n",

    "### Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "````{dropdown} View steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Restoring an R environment can often run into issues, especially with older projects or system differences. Below are common problems and solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unavailable packages\n",
    "\n",
    "When recreating environments with older R versions or package versions, you may encounter errors if those packages are no longer available for your chosen R version. CRAN often archives older packages, and support for very old R versions is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptoms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Errors stating that a package or a specific version cannot be found or installed.\n",
    "* Installation fails even though the package exists for newer R versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If exact reproducibility isn't critical, update to a more recent R version and/or newer package versions.\n",
    "* For legacy work, search for archived source tarballs or consult the CRAN archive, but success isn't guaranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Backdating\n",
    "\n",
    "If you set up your environment with the latest R and package versions (for example, when no specific versions are listed), you may find your code requires older package versions to work as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptoms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code relies on functions or behaviors from earlier package versions.\n",
    "* Latest package versions introduce breaking changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Specify minimum or exact versions in your `DESCRIPTION` file.\n",
    "* Be aware that not all old versions are available for every R version; you may need to adjust your R version or accept a newer package.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing system dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Some R packages require external system libraries (e.g., C libraries, database clients) not installed by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptoms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Package installation fails with errors about missing libraries (e.g., \"cannot find -lssl\", \"libcurl not found\", missing `.so` files).\n",
    "* Consult the CRAN page for each package (OR SPECIFIED ONE IN ERROR?); most list system requirements. As an example, the openssl and curl packages commonly require system libraries. See this GitHub issue for a real-world case and solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Check the CRAN page for each package for system requirements. The `openssl` and `curl` packages are a common source of these issues.\n",
    "* Install the required system dependencies and document them in your `README` for others. For example:\n",
    "  * Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev`.\n",
    "  * Fedora/RHEL: `sudo dnf install openssl-devel libcurl-devel`.\n",

    "\n",
    "On systems where R has been installed for a long time, the user library (the default location for installed packages) may contain outdated or conflicting packages. This can interfere with `renv`, sometimes causing it to fail silently or behave unpredictably.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptoms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `renv` commands have no effect or fail with unclear messages.\n",
    "* Packages are loaded from the user library instead of the project library.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Check `.libPaths()` to confirm the project library is listed first when `renv` is active.\n",
    "* Temporarily move or rename your user library directory and restart R to see if `renv` works correctly.\n",
    "* If issues persist, consider reinstalling R or resetting your user library.\n",
    "* As a last resort, a clean operating system install can resolve deep or persistent conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General tips\n",
    "\n",
    "**Update renv:** Bugs are fixed regularly - ensure you're using the latest version.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check permissions:** Make sure you have write access to your project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consult logs:** Use `renv::diagnostics()` to generate a report on your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Search for known issues:** Many problems are discussed (and solved) in the [renv GitHub Issues](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/issues) tracker.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's put theory into practice! These activities are designed to help you experience real-world workflows for managing R environments using `renv` and `rig`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activity 1: Create a reproducible R project from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Set up a new R project with `renv`, add a package, capture the environment for reproducibility, and share it with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggested package and script:** Use the `ggplot2` package, and create a script named `plot_example.R` with the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "library(ggplot2)\n",
    "ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) + geom_point()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{dropdown} View solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a new R project.**\n",
    "    * In RStudio: Go to \"File\" > \"New Project...\" and choose \"New Directory\" or \"Existing Directory\" as needed.\n",
    "2. **Initialize `renv`.**\n",
    "    * In the R console, run:\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      install.packages(\"renv\")\n",
    "      renv::init()\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "3. **Install a package.**\n",
    "    * For example, to add `ggplot2`, add this to a `DESCRIPTION` file and then run\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      renv::install()\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "4. **Write and run a simple script.**\n",
    "    * Create a new R script (e.g., `plot_example.R`) with:\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      library(ggplot2)\n",
    "      ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) + geom_point()\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    * Run the script to confirm everything works.\n",
    "5. **Snapshot the environment.**\n",
    "    * Save the current state of your environment:\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      renv::snapshot()\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    * This updates the `renv.lock` file, recording all package versions.\n",
    "6. **Share your project.**\n",
    "    * Your project folder now contains everything needed for someone else to reproduce your analysis - just share the folder (via GitHub, ZIP, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Review the **üì¶ Packages** page for more information on these steps.\n",

    "    * `cd renv-reproduce-activity`\n",
    "2. **Switch to the required R version.**\n",
    "    * Check the `renv.lock` file or `README` for the required R version.\n",
    "    * Use `rig` (or your preferred tool) to switch R versions.\n",
    "3. **Restore the project environment.**\n",
    "    * Open the project in RStudio.\n",
    "    * Run `renv::restore()`.\n",
    "4. **Run the example code.**\n",
    "    * Locate and run the provided R script (`analysis.R`).\n",
