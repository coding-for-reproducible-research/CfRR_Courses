    "````{tab-item} Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "A **virtual environment** is an isolated workspace for your projects. The focus on this short course will be Python virtual environments, however the concept exists beyond just Python. It keeps all your project’s dependencies (libraries, packages, etc.) separate from other projects and from your system-wide installations. This isolation ensures that installing or updating a dependency in one project does not affect other projects or your system Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Virtual Environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dependency Management**  \n",
    "   Different projects might require different versions of python or different versions of a particular library in order to work. A virtual environment allows each project to maintain its own set of dependencies, completely separate from other projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reproducibility**  \n",
    "   Sharing code is easier when collaborators can recreate the exact environment you used, avoiding the “it works on my machine” problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **System Integrity**  \n",
    "   Installing or updating packages system-wide can break other applications. Virtual environments confine these changes to the environment, leaving system Python untouched.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using venv across different operating systems \n",
    "\n",
    "Creating an exhaustive list of all of the different environments and package managers across all the different operating systems would be far too extensive to include as a short course here. As such, the two most common operating systems in use today, MacOS and Windows, are included here with the manager that is bundled with Python already, venv allowing you to get started with one manager on your operating system and explore other managers in your own time via the tutorials linked within this course. All of the managers' websites will highlight the pros of the manager that they are proposing, so the manager you should use will depend on your personal preference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that between the different operating system sections, there is some repetition of content to ensure that each of the different sections is able to be studied as stand-alone sections. \n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "````{tab-item} MacOS Use\n",
    "\n",
    "### MacOS \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Opening the Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step on macOS to create a virtual environment is to open the 'Terminal'. This can be done by searching for the program and clicking on the program icon, which is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} figures/virtual_environments/terminal_icon.png\n",
    ":alt: Terminal icon dark grey square with white greater underscore symbol\n",
    ":width: 300px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should then open a window such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} figures/virtual_environments/macos_terminal.png\n",
    ":alt: MacOS terminal window showing command prompt\n",
    ":width: 1000px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands can then be typed directly into the terminal and executed by pressing Return. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verifying Python Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "You can verify that Python is installed correctly by running: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "This should produce a output stating the installed python version, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Python 3.12.4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Minor differences in the python version (beyond the first `.`) will not matter for the most part. However, unless you have a specific reason to use Python 2, the version should start with a 3. If it does not or if Python is not found on your system then you can install it via the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Note that depending on your particular configuration, your Python might be accessed via another alias, such as 'python3' or 'py', resulting in the desired command being 'python3 --version'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically Python is invoked by calling python followed by the path to a python script file, containing some code: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python example_script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling Python from command line with no other arguments will open the [interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html) (indicated by the `>>>` prompt), where python commands can be executed in an interactive manner. This is rarely used as the code written is cleared when the interpreter is exited, which can be done by executing the `exit()` command: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    ">>> exit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checking what is currently installed\n",
    "Python comes with some default packages installed already, and installation of packages is typically managed through PIP (a recursive acronym for \"pip install package\"). We can see what is currently installed system-wide using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip list \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "we could install more packages system-wide using pip, but it is better to do so in a virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating an environment \n",
    "\n",
    "An environment can be created with the following command: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv virtual_environment_1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On macOS this can then be activated with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source virtual_environment_1/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your command line should now have a hint that highlights which environment you are currently in. This is key as it will make it easy at a glance to understand which environment you are in. Your command line should now look something like: \n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} figures/virtual_environments/venv_terminal_hint.png\n",
    ":alt: MacOS terminal with virtual environment active showing environment name in prompt\n",
    ":width: 1000px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now deactivate the environment with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which will remove the environment hint from the command line, highlighting that you are no longer in any virtual environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "You would now be able to create a and activate a second virtual environment, called `virtual_environment_2` with the following commands: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv virtual_environment_2\n",
    "source virtual_environment_2/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and easily switch between the two of them by first using `deactivate` and then `source <environment_name>/bin/activate`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing a package\n",
    "\n",
    "Whith a virtual environment active, when we go to install a package it can be a good idea to check which packages are already installed.  This can be done with the following command: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip list \n",
    "```\n",
    "This should give you a list of different python packages that are current installed. If you wanted to install a new package, [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for example (a very widespread Python Data Analysis Library), then you could run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when you check which packages are installed using `pip list` you should see that pandas is installed and can be imported into code written with this environment active using `import pandas` (feel free to try this in the interactive shell). If you were to now run `deactivate` and `pip list` again you would see that the pandas packages is not listed. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the key goal of virtual environments: allowing you to easily swap between different configurations of packages and their respective versions without uninstalling and reinstalling everything. For example it might be the case that on one of your projects you need to use `pandas 2.2.2`, but that this is incompatible with some other package used in a different project, which only works with `pandas 1.8.0`. Using virtual environments allows each project to install the working version of pandas without replacing the version installed in the other project. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "````{tab-item} Windows Use\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Opening the Command Prompt (CMD) or PowerShell \n",
    "\n",
    "On windows, you can open the **Command Prompt** by:\n",
    "1. Clicking on the **Start** menu (Windows icon).\n",
    "2. Typing **cmd** or **Command Prompt**\n",
    "3. Clicking on the **Command Prompt** icon.\n",

    ":width: 1000px\n",
