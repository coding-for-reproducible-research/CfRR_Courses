    "## Course Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand and write functions in R.\n",
    "* Understand the difference between local and global variables.\n",
    "* Apply best practices to avoid common programming errors related to variable usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a reusable block of code that takes inputs (described by **parameters**), performs operations and returns an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using functions in your code has several advantages:\n",
    "* Reduce redundancy: by writing a function once and reusing it whenever needed, you avoid repeating the same code in muliple places.\n",
    "* Enhances modularity: functions allow you to structure your code into modules, each performing a specific task, making development and maintenance easier.\n",
    "* Facilitates testing: because functions are self-contained, they can be tested individually to ensure they work correctly before integrating them into the larger program.\n",
    "* Improves readability: well-named functions break down complex scripts into clear, logical components, making your code easier for you and others to read and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This short course is a practical introduction to writing functions in R. It covers key concepts to help you structure code, avoid repetition, and write clearer scripts. For more in-depth learning, including default parameter values and other topics, see the [Software Carpentry “Creating Functions”](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/02-func-R.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before Writing Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "* When writing functions, give them meaningful names. The format `verb_noun` can be useful, such as `add_summaries`.\n",
    "* Always document the inputs and outputs with comments to explain what the function expects and returns. Also document any other 'side effects', e.g. messages printed to the console, files written or global variables modified (see later about global variables).\n",
    "* To keep your project organised, save functions in separate scripts within a dedicated directory (for example, an `R/`folder).\n",
    "* You can import these functions into your main script using `source(\"R/file_name.R\")`, which makes them available for use in your workflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example of a function that aims to subset a table of patient data (`patient_data`) by the `phenotype_code` found in the column named `code`. We start by defining the function first:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "filter_by_phenotype <- function(patient_data, phenotype_code) {\n",
    "  filtered_data <- patient_data[patient_data$code == phenotype_code, ]\n",
    "  return(filtered_data)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the diagram below, the function is broken down into 3 components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The name of the function: `filter_by_phenotype`.\n",
    "2. The function parameters: `patient_data`, `phenotype_code`.\n",
    "3. The body of the function:\n",
    "```r\n",
    "  filtered_data <- patient_data[patient_data$code == phenotype_code, ]\n",
    "  return(filtered_data)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![function diagram](figures/r_functions/pic_function.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use the function on an actual dataframe of patient data (called `data`, say) and phenotype code (`101`, say), the function needs to be called as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write the name of the function (in this case `filter_by_phenotype`).\n",
    "2. Replace the parameters `patient_data` and `phenotype_code` with the actual variables/values (`data` and phenotype code `101`)\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "filter_by_phenotype(data, 101)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's store the filtered table into an object called `result` and print it:\n",
    "```r\n",
    "result <- filter_by_phenotype(data, 101)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the components are:\n",
    "\n",
    "![function diagram2](figures/r_functions/pic_function2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The filtered table will be stored in the `result` and the initial table used as input `data` will be unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise: Write your own function\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function that takes in as an argument a dataframe `data` with column name `x` containing numbers. The function should return a dataframe with a new column, called `x_pow2`, that is the square of the values in column `x`. (E.g. if `x` is a column with values `1, 2, 3` then `x_pow2` should contain `1, 4, 9`. Make sure to give your function a good name!\n",
    "2. Evaluate your function from 1 on some different dataframes (which you create) to check that it works.\n",
    "3. Now modify your function to take in two arguments: a dataframe `data` as before, but also an integer `n`. The function should now return a dataframe with a new column `x_pow{n}` which raises the values in `x` to the `n`th power. (For example, if `n=3` the new column should be called `x_pow3`.) Make sure the function has a good name! Try your function with different values for `n` to check it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise: Guess the output\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following function, that takes a dataframe with a column called `age` and sets all the rows to have a particular age:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "set_age <- function(data, new_age) {\n",
    "    data$age <- new_age\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider the following dataframe:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "df <- data.frame(name = c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Claire\", \"David\"),\n",
    "                 age = c(21, 23, 34, 43))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you think will be printed by the following code?\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "set_age(df, 99)\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Check your answer by running the code yourself."
